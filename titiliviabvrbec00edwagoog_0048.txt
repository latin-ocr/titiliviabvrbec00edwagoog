And the reign of Servius Tullius is really of the same type,
though ostensibly more beneficent and popular: the confirmation

of his kingship (haud dubius rex) by successful war with Veii3

ganisation3 the suovetaurilia (an old rite used for a state
purpose), the temple of Diana3 the extension of the city and
fortifications beyond the old pomerium3 the division of captured
land on a popular basis; the popular approval of his kingship.
Such government is not imperium in the Roman sense3 it is
Greek tyranny—dominatio in the text at the head os this section.
The traditional accounts doubtless owe much to the influence of
Greek culture in Etruria at the time of the Tarquins (tle. in
the seventh and sixth centuries B.c.), and to the Hellenizing
tendency os Greek annalists when the story came to be written:
but it is just conceivable that the Tarquins may stand fora Greek
or a Graeco-Etruscan family settled in the town of the same
name, and seizing from thence some opportunity of political
unrest at Rome to set up a tyranny of the pattern prevalent
about this era in different parts os the Hellenic world¹. Such
tyrannies frequently lasted for more than one generation: and
Greek writers who remembered Cypselus and Periander, Ortha-
goras and CleistheneS, Peisistratus and Hippias, were not
unlikely to expand the tyranny of the Tarquins accordingly, as a
necessary chapter in the political history of Rome.

tyranny at Rome does not necessarily imply a belief that those
Tarquinii were Etruscans. Such, it is true, was the accepted
tradition when Livy wrote; 'and it is accepted also by most
modern authorities, On the other hand the rule of an
Etruscan dynasty in Rome itsels is disputed even by scholars
who are prepared to acknowledge that ‘Etruscan supremacy in
Latium and Campania is one os the most certain facts’ in the
