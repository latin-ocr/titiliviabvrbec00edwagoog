but language. The advent of the SabineS, a part of the Umbro-
Sabellian stock, brought that accession of strength and character
which spelt success sor Rome. And it is possible to believe ¹, by
the evidence of religion, of marriage and succession‚ of armament,
of burial or cremation, and of language‚ that these same Sabines
were in effect the patres of Rome, wh0‚ in themselves and their
descendants the patrzcii, evinced towards the Latini, in other
words the plebs, all the superiority and exclusiveness of a
conquering race. That is to say, the essential opposition, through
centuries of conflict, between Patricians and Plebeians may
conceivably be traced back to racial and not merely to social
differences. There is no doubt that this view of the case simpli-
fies and explains many difficult and doubtful points», in the regal
, period no less than in the earliest ages of the republic.

In this and the following sections it is proposed to trace the
growth of the city-state and its institutions during the . regal Ι
period, and to examine the traditional record of that growth as ’
given by Livy. Annalists and archaeologists are generally
agreed-ea nec adfirmare nec refellere in animo est—that the
earliest settlement of the Rome to be was on the Palatium or
mons Palatinus. From a strategical point of view it was the
· best hill by the Tiber, and its shape, a rough square with sides

of steep rock, about 500 yards long, made it easily capable of
defence. Walls, of which fragments still stand, 'were let into
