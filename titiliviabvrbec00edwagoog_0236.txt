5 5 8. ex summi...1uoo] This grove (probably of oak-trees) on a
hill-top indicates that the deity belongs to a very early time, before the
period of temples and statues in human shape--the pre-Roman Jupiter,
in fact, who continued to be worshipped on the Alban Mount at the
Feriae Latinae every year till the end of the third century A-D.‚ as the
presiding genius of the Latin communities= cf. Fowler, R. F. pp. 95—7‚

12 aruspicum monitu] In most cases of prodigies in historical times the
sacred books (of Etruscan origin) supplied rules of expiation 3 in doubtful
cases the aruspices (= ‘ diviners,' ‘ soothsayers '), Sibylline bookS, or
Delphic Oracle (cf. 56. 5 below) were consulted as to the proper steps os
expiation (supplicatio). The aruspices themselves seem to have been of
Etruscan origin3 their art dealt with the interpretation of the entrails in
sacrifice, and of extraordinary phenomena in nature: cf. 5 5, 6, 56. 5.
