ς 4. ab] gives the occasion of the departure, implying both
sequence and consequence (cf. ἐξ).

ι 5 ducentibus ntis] Aeneas is always the ⁸ Man of Destiny.’

in moniam] i.e. to Aenea, on the west coast of Chalcidice.

17 tenuium] intransitive, ‘steered for’: so elsewhere in Livy (e.g.
xxxl. 45. 14 Cassandream petentes, primo ad Mendin tenuere), and
in Ovid (e.g. Met. 1'1. 140 medio tutissimus ibis-...inter utrumque tene).
Cf. Soph. Phil. 220 τίνει ποτ’ εἰς γῆν τήνδε...κατέσχετε;

p. 4. ι ἓ ⁸. ut quibus] See n. on atquae, Praef. 4.

ab nummo prope] For ab see n. above. prope=fere, an apology
for the use of immemo in a figurative sense: the same adjective needs
no apology in Praef. 4, where it has its literal meaning. ·

2 sufflet] Most MSS. have superessent, which, if accepted, would
be a construction to suit the sense, i.e. nihil pmeter arma et naves=arma
et naves.

4 Aborigines] The name suggests its own derivation from ab origine—
ὥσπερ ἂν ἡμεῖς εἴποιμεν γενεάρχας ἢ rpem-ydrons, as Dionysius says
(1. 10), or more simply οἱ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς. The usual Greek spelling of the
name is ’Λβοριγῖνες, but a variant form Ἀβερριγῖνες (i.e. wanderers), is
given by Dionysius. On the question of their identity, see the Introduction.

6 ἓ 0. inde] ‘from this point.' The first version is given in the
Aeneid (last six books): Livy agrees with Virgil sor the most part in this
opening chapter.

5 ’1. merent] Probably the subjunctive here is due to the oratio ’

V obliqua: but Livy affects it with prius quam, even where little or no
notion of anticipation is implied. The verb is probably intransitive:
‘sounded.’ .

9 minores] ⁸ the front ranks.’

1 1 protecti] essent may be understood from the previous clause, or
(better) the phrase unde...prqfecti may be taken as qualifying exissent.
For the contracted form cf. 7. 7 mugr'ssent.

Θ g ⁸. audierit] This use of a primary tense in the midst os an oratio
obliqua, and following historic tenses (essent, exissent), is an example of
repraesentatio, or a reproduction of the tense os the oratio recta—in this
case audiit. Livy frequently admits such variations from the hard and
fast ‘rule ’ of oratio obliqua: in all probability he desired to retain the
tenses of the oratio recta, but was hampered by the limited tense-
capacities of the subjunctive mood. This is the view of Dr R. S.
Conway, set forth in a useful appendix to his edition of Book ιι, from
which the following general principles are quoted ι
