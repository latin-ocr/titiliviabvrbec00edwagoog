miranda...spooee] Cf. 7. 4 boves mira specie.

ἠ monumentumJ We should say (as also in 36. 5) that they were
rather the cause, than the evidence, os the marvel. The nailing up of
the horus of the victims seems to have been part of the ceremonial of
sacrifices to Artemis, e. g. in Taurica. Plutarch (Q. R. 4, quoted by
Seeley) says, διὰ τί τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἀρτεμισίοις ἐπετείως ἐλάφων κέρατα προσ-
πατταλεύουσι, τῷ δ’ Ἀβεντίνῳ βοῶν ‚· For the dat. ei miraculo see n.
on 5. 6 Numitori.

23 ς 6. prodigii 1000] Cf. 39. 4 liberum loce.

cecinere vates] The seerS, who would be consulted as to the
treatment of the prodigy‚ delivered their reply (responsum below) in

dolore Thetis. For cuperet..facta see n. on 23. 8 monitum velim.

3 Romanus] According to Plutarch (Q. Rem. 4) Servius planned the
trick‚ and sacrificed the cow.
mire] Livy is fond os this word as an emphasis (see θα above), as is
Pliny in his letters: Cicero uses mirifice in the same way. Both are
robably colloquial.

CHAPTER XLVI.

dubius rex (see 4²· 3).
8 Μυκη populi] This was literally true; see 41. 6.
10 asro...d:lviso] Servius (as Weissenborn points out) adopts the same
method of eatehing the popular vote as the tribunes of later dayS.
