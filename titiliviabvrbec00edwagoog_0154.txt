86 LIVY. I [1§8

ἴ Α. In passages of Oratio Obliqua in which Livy is using Primam!
T enses aster a past governing Vere), the Primary T enses appear, as a
ride, only where they are actually retained from the Oratio Recta ,· i.e.
(1) all retainable Tenses are retained with great regularity ,- but (α)
*where a change of T ense is unavoidable (as in converting the Imperative
and the Future os the Oratio Recta), there Livy's usage varies, but the

’ Tense chosen is most often Secondary.

Β. (1) The Subjunctives which depend directly upon the Main
Verb which introduces the Oratio Obliqua, take the regular Sequence ,-
thus‚ they are Secondary aster a Past T ense, whether or not the Primam*
T enses are retained in the body of the speech itseff. .

(2) Similarly the Imperfect Subjunctive which is regularly used to
give a Past Command throws any Verbs that may depend upon it into
Secondary‘ T enses ; and this influence sometimes extends even into the
next sentence.

Θ condendaeque urbis locum] a genitive of description: cf. 15. 63
47. 8; 48. 9 ; ΙΧ. 45. 18 oratores pacis petendae. urbi is also read, in
which case the dative expresses a notion of object or of ‘ work contem-
plated ' (Roby ὅ 481): cs. v. 54. 4 urbi condendae locum elegerunt3 xxx.
22. 6 locum condendo oppido ceperunt.

· nobilitatem] ‘ renown.’ ‚

Campanos paratos eruptioni sore. ,

18 j ἕ 9. ictum] Strictly speaking it was the victim‚ not the treaty‚
which was ‘ struck‚’ but the object of the action passes into the result s
cf.-fstrike (hands upon) a bargain! , ’

20 penates deos] ‘ household gods ’ (perhaps connected with pentir,
‘ store-room ’ ε cf. penetralia). Livy thus admits a prehistoric origin for
the very ancient rites of the Penates (and Vesta) at Lavinium, which
every consul, dictator, and praetor, at the beginning and the end os- his
office, was bound to celebrate. Lavinium was in effect the religious
metropolis of the Latin communities and of Rome, and retained its
importance as such until the fall of paganism. ·

22 ἓ 10. unque] ‘undoubtedly,' ‘at any rate 'z implying previous
uncertainty. ·

etabffl...sede] ‘in a sure and certain settlement ’z the two epithets
