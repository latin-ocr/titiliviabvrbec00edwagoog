concerned with the numerica-l discrepancy between the old and the new
arrangement.

· Now if, in the new arrangement, there had been in each tribe a
single, instead of a double, reckoning of centurieS‚ we should have had a
total of (35 x 5 =) 175 centurieS, i.e. one century of each class in each
tribe. This (if we disregard the 18 centuries of equites in both cases) is
the same as the Servian total of 170 centuries of infantry -Ι- the 5
centuries of supernumeraries and proletarii: and therefore the double
reckoning of 350 centuries (ιο to a tribe) might well seem to be a
duplication of the Servian 17 5, and so to suggest some reference to the
Servian classification, and some connection between it and the Servian
tribeS.

Livy then desiroe to refute such a supposition3 first, by stating
incidentally that the number of centuries in the reconstituted comitia
does not agree with the Servian total; and secondly‚ by the statement
next following, that the triba] divisions of Servius had nothing to do with
the centuriate arrangement, although tribes and centuries were afterwards
combined for this purpose.

regionibus comumque] may be taken (1) as in apposition to urbe
(so Weissenborn-Manet), or (α) as indicating the lines of division
-‘ according to the districts and hius: The latter seems the, better
interpretation. One of the ‘ tribes ' concerned was named (Sucusana,
later Suburana) from a district, the other three from hius (Palatina,
Esquilina, Collina) ε or, if the word collibus is to be regarded here (so
W.·M.) as distinct from montes, it applies to the Viminal and Quirinal
(regio Collina), and regionibus to the rest.

In any case, the four ‘ regions ' represent in all probability a pre·
Servian division, which was now utilized for a definite purpose—the
census and the collection of the tributum: the area actually included

within the Servian rampart was considerably larger.
4 mbas. . ,α tributo] This derivation cannot be accepted, for tributum

surely comes from tribus. There is some reason to doubt the comben-
tional derivation of tm‘bus from tros, which may have been suggested by
the coincidence that the three chief partners in the earliest state of Rome
were so called. .

The -prevalent connotation of tribus is ‘part' or ‘district‚’ without
regard to number (cf. tn‘buo): and here Servius is represented as
