ter and pes, or from terripavium (pavire, ‘beat ⁹) acc. to Cicero de Div.
11. 34, 72.

ἓ 6. pontificem] This official (as were the pontiffs of the Republic)
was concerned with the state relig-ion as a whole, not associated (like the
flamines, Vestales and Salii) with a particular deity or rite. The usual
derivation connects the word with pom· and facio, and supposes that
bridges (e. g. the Pons Sublicius-see 33. 6 below) were connected
with certain acts of worship or propitiation. According to x. 6, the
original number of pontiffs was four: Cicero (de Rep- 11. 14, 26) says five.
There was probably no pontifex maximus under the KingS, as these
themselves were chief priests ex efficia

Is it possible that pontefices is to be derived from a root pont· or
pompt· (i.e. five, cf. Pontius, Pompilius) and fac·, and that it means
‘ five doerS,’ i.e. ‘sacrificers,' ‘celebrants ’ ? This would agree with the
view that there were five pontiffs originally: and it is known that they
were closely associated with formalities os real and personal transfer
(wills and adoptions)‚ in which they may well have been the five
witnesses required for a transaction per aes et libram. In the earlier
regal period they seem to have formed the king's court before which a
civil suit (lis) was settled3 and the legis actio sacramenti certainly
suggests that there was a sacral clement in such procedure which
the pontifices may have introduced. Cf. Muirhead, Roman Law,
PP· 722 7 3·

28 Numam Marcium] Possibly we ought to read Numa Marcium, and
to suppose that Marcius was the husband of N uma’s daughter and the
father of Ancus Marcius: this would be an indication of succession in
'the female line. (See Introduction, ἓξ 5, 7.) Like many other names
in this book Marcius was probably introduced into the tradition to
¹ glorify a noble Roman house.

29 exempta. exsignataque] ‘ exactly copied and recorded '--probably
from Sabine originals. The record so made may well be the com-
mentarii mentioned in 32. α below. [Weissenborn-Malla]

31 flerent] This subj. (like erogaretur, susciperentur atque curarentur
below) expresses a deliberative sense, in a dependent clause: cf. 17. 11
decerneret qui regnaret, 29. 3 obliti quid relinquerent.

32 erogaretur] ‘was to be disbursed’: erogare is the technical term for
‚paying out money from the public treasury (cf. de publico, ἓ 3 above)
with the consent of the people.

ἕ e. pubuea...saora] There were two general divisions os sacra—
publica‚ those performed at public expense for the public benefit, or for
