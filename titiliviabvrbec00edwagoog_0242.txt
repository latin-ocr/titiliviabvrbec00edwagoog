second expression is merely a more definite restaternent 'of -the ‘same

fact. For the pair of ablatives see note on η. ιο.
31 ηψπ] i-e. there was fighting round about the walls and in the open-

comminus in the second clause implies that a good deal of the fighting ἢ
in the other case was carried on eminus, at long range. ι

p, 45. ἰ 5 6. Μωμωοωιιιι] ‘with a supreme effort of his
whole force.’

6 ad numo] i.e. ad aram (sacellum) Murciae, in the valley asterwards
occupied by the Circus MaximuS, between the Palatine and the Aventine. ῃ
The name Murcia may belong to the valley itself (i.e. ‘swampy‚‘ cf.
marceo) 3 or to an old name of the Aventine ; or to an ancient goddess of
⁸ Ease’ (cf. mulcere, Mulciber, and marcidus ‘ indolent ⁹), perhaps brought
thither by the Latin immigrants on this ocoesiom and then applied as an
epithet to Venus (cf. Libentina and Volupia). The variant spellings
Martia, Myrtea led some ,antiquarians (eg. Varro, L. L. v. ἓ 154) to
connect the word with the myrtle. In any case, this became the most
important shrine of Venus in Rome. Cf. Preller, R. M„ 1. pp. 438—9.

5 ο. Iamonlum] i.e. the abode ofJanus, who was supposed to have
reigned there in the prehistoric age. The oak woods on this hill may
supply the explanation for the connection os the god with i‘t.

8 muro] i.e. the spot selected as an outwork was enclosed. But it is
by no means probable that the Janiculum was sortified thus early:
perhaps Livy is repeating a mistake contained in his authorities.

.ob commoditatem itineris] ‘ for convenience of transit. ‘

9 ponto suuncio] ‘the bridge of piles ’ (sublicae). It was originally
made of wood throughout (perhaps lest the use of iron might offend the
river-god), and had often to be repaired in consequence.

in Tiberim] ‘ over the Tiber.’ The abl. with in is more usual in this
phrase, and is read here by Madvig: but the acc. may be defended on
the ground of the motion implied in the actual construction.

10 ἓ ’1. Quiritium quoquo fossa] quoque here refers not to the word
immediately preceding, but to Quiritium fossa, taken together as a
single notion. Cf. 36. 1 muro quoquc lapideo...parabat. The position
of the Quiritium fossa is not known. Such dykes might well precede
more definite fortification of the city. Festus (p. 2 54) mentions Quiritium
fissae dug in the reign of Ancus Marcius round Ostia ς another authority
(de Vir. Ill. vm. 1. 3) applies the same term to the sewers dug by the

onder of Tarquinius Superbus. ,

proach’. cf.12. ἰ ab Sabinis, 17. 2 ab sua parte, 37. 3 ab cornibus
