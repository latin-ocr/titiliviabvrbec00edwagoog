now, when of the original 142 books only 35 have survived
(Ῑ to X, and ΧΧΙ to XLV), these periochae remairi for us, the
melancholy ruins of a monumental aehievement .

*f Livy called his own work annalem and the title ns not inap
propriate, at any rate for those earlier parts 'of the history in
which his record evidently rests upon the Roman annalist's. The
earliest of them (Q. Fabius Pictor-and L. Cincius Alimentus)
began to write about the time-os the Second' Punic War, and the
suceession lasted till the time of Julius Caesar. They were
narratores rerum non exornatores ¹, and their method · of· work
was to relate the whole of Roman history from its origins to
their own day. As authorities they use‘d official· documents and
records on the one hand, an'd family memorials on the other: in
the former class were treaties (such a's that with Gabii), lists of
consuls, pontifical books, libri lintei3 in the latter, funeral
orations, poemS, pedigreeS, personal memoirs.' Their sympathies
with families or with political parties found frequent expression&-
and they cannot be said to have h'ad any strlct or scientific
regard for truth. . · ’

- The earlier annalists seem to have given but a slight ae'count
of the origins of Rome and the regal period : the later annalists
expanded the tradition, by the incorporation of more material,
legendar'y. or imag-inam, with no little assistance from Greek
sources, 'The later works were in'effect larger editions of the
earlier, and tended to replace them in popular acceptance: and
investigation seem's' to prove that 'Livy adhered 'mainly to the'
later ‘annalists as his authorities for the earliest times. Thus
Book 11 appears to be an abridgment of· the regal history of·
Q. Valerius Antias (fl. in the age of Sulla), with fairly large,
excerpts from Q. Aelius Tubero (fl. 50 ΒΩ.) ἱίι.;ῐῑιέ casezof· the
later reigns, but to have little' immediate relationship with L.'
Calpurnius Piso (consul, 133 B.'c.) or C. Licinius Macer.(fl. 75 Βία),
both of whom, however, are used in the four following books.
Livy's method seems to have been to follow one authority at a
time, usually without acknowledgment: occasionally he adds at
