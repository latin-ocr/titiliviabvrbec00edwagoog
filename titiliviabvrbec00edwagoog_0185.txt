vm ξ 7] NOTES 105

expand and explain the other ablative (=means). For the use os the
gerund see n. on 5. 6.

17 in apem] ‘in anticipation‚’ ξ in accordance with their hope ἐ cf. τι. 2
in mores. futurae multitudinis] ‘ of a population to be ’—-a favourite
Livian use of the future participle.

18 ad m, quoa...erat] ‘to suit the present number of persons.’ leomi-
num, gen. of divided whole: cf. 2 5. 1 quidquid civium domi...sit. ’

19 ξ ὅ. ma] in literal sense, ‘ empty)

21 vetere eumne] ‘in accordance with the established policy.’

obscuram atquo humilem] ‘mean and lowly’: cf. Cic. in Verr. 11. 5.
70, ἓ 181 Pompeius humili atque obscuro loco natus.

2 3 qui nuno...est] ‘ which is seen on descent, an enclosure to this day,
the Two-Grove Clearing.' Livy omits to state that this spot called
Inter Duos Lucos (cf. Dion. H. 11. 15. 4 μεθόριον δυεῖν δρυμῶν) was on
the Capitoline; it was in fact the col between the two eminences
of that hill, on which woods were believed once to have existed.
lucus itself originally meant ⁸ a clearing‚’ a sense which may have
survived in Lucus Asyli, another title os this spot. escendentibus] The
dat. gives the point of view (i.e. the ‘person judging‚' Roby‚ §477); it
is like the Greek usage, cf. Thuc. 1. 24. 1 Ἐπίδαμνός ἐστι πόλις ἐν δεξιᾷ
ἐσπλέοντι τὸν Ἰόνιον κόλπον, also ²3· 10 quaerentibus, and Plin. Ν. H.
xvm. 35 verum confitentibus latifundia perdidere Italiam.

If descendentibus is the right reading, Livy’s account must be taken
from an authority who has just described the Capitol. But perhaps we
ought to read escendentibus (escendo and descendo are again confused in
v111. 10. η), which may have been a word specially appropriate for
climbing the Capitol: cf. 10. 5 below.

²4 asylum] ‘as a refuge,’ in apposition to locum: cs. Virg. Aen.
vnl. 342 hinc lucum ingentem, quem Romulus acer Asylum rettulit...

- monstrat.

25 5 0. nine dumne...emt] ‘ without distinction whether bond or
free! discrimine implies a question, and therefore takes (utmm)...an:
cf. 33. 8.

26 primum...roboris] ‘the first element os strength towards the great·
ness essayed.’ coepta magnitudo is an echo offutura multitudo above.
28 5 ’1. eonsilium...parat] ‘ provided a council sor his forces! The
dat. expresses indirect object, with a sense also of close relationship:

cs. η. 4 urbi fundamenta ieci. For consilium, cf. 49. 7.

centum] Dionysius Hal. (11. ια) gives the composition thus: 1

king’s deputy ÷9 (3)( 3) tribal representatives' ÷9o (3>< 30) gentile
