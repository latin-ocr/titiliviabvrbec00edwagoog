31 esunt] i.efflQQubjumfflae

32 nuos cuique] The possessive pronoun here refers not to the subject,
but to the remoter object of the sentence. cf. 52. 4 sui cuique periculi3
Cic. de Off 1.5. 14 in tribuendo suum cuique.

p.26.1 ἓ Θ. omnium prmum] A definite calendar was a necessary
preliminary to a detailed worship. ΜΠ( to suit,’ ‘according to' (κατά).

2 discribit] ‘marks off,’ ‘distributes' (this spelling of the word is
to be preferred in all cases where the notion of ‘distribution ’ is implied):
cf. 42. 5 and XLV. 15. 1 in quattuor urbanas tribus discripti erant libertini.

tricenos alumnis] The distributive sense of the words is emphasized.

4 desunt dies...a.nno] either (1) ‘the days fail to make up (fall short of)
a full (i.e. a solar) year3 or (2) ‘days are wanting for....' For solidus
cf. Hor. od. 1. 1. 20 partem solido demere de die.

qui..,orb0] either (1) ‘which is the circuit of a solar revolution,’
i.e. solstitiali is used loosely for solari3 or (2) ‘which is formed by
(represents) a revolution from solstice to solstice,' i.e. from summer to
summer.

5 mterealarfls] lit. ‘proclaimed between‚’ so ‘inserted by proclamation,’
‘supernumerary.' The proclamation of such alterations in the calendar
was made (in Republican times) by the Pontiffs, who summoned the
comitia curiata (called in this case comitia calata, i.e. ‘ summoned ’) for
the purpose.

6 dispensavit] ⁶ arranged,’ ⁶ regulated.’

ut vicesimo anne...d:les congruerent] ‘that in the twentieth year the
periods of all the years should be filled up, and the days should coincide
with the same point of the sun’s course from which they had started ⁹ ;
i.e. Numa introduced a pure lunar year, reconciling it with the solat
year by inserting a certain number of months in every cycle. The -
length of his cycle (vicesimo anno-:every 19 years) is the same as that
of Meton, who reformed the Greek calendar in 432 B.c.: it is possible
therefore that Livy here attributes to Numa what belongs to another
time and place, following the pious fraud of some pontiff, who wished
to give the traditional founder of the calendar the credit of astronomical

accuracy. In Meton's cycle each period of seven years received one
intercalary month.

It was commonly believed that the earliest Roman year, called the
‘ Year os Romulus,’ consisted of 304 days, arranged in 10 monthS,
beginning with March, and ending with December. Now this number
of days agrees neither with the sun nor with the moon ; the next arrange-
ment, however, ascribed to Numa, consisted of 12 lunar months, or
