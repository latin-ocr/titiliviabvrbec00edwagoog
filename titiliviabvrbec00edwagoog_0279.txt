tion.‘ In historical times this rite was performed by the¹ censors every
five years (hence the secondary meaning of lustrum, a period of five
years), when the census was finished.

17 . Fabius Pictor] belongs to the period τεο-τοο 13.c.= he wrote in
Greek (there was afterwards a Latin version also) a history of Rome
from Aeneas’ time to his own. His account of the foundation of Rome
was used by Dionysius 3 Livy refers to him not infrequently (e-g. in
5 5—8 below), and sometimes quotes him, but it is not clear whether he
regarded him as his chief authority.

19 ἕ 8. ad] ‘in view of,’ ‘to meet': cf. 8. 4.

20 Quirinalem vimmemque] These two hills (the term mons is never
applied to them) and the Esquiline are separate at the southern end,
but towards the north-east form a continuous plateau, along which
the agger of Servius was now thrown up. See the plan of Rome.
The name Quirinalis is variously derivedz cf. Varro, L. L. V. 51 collis
Quirinalis ob Quirini fanum .· sunt qui a Quiritibus, qui cum T. Tatio
Curibus venerunt Romam, quod ibi habaet-tent castra. See also the note
on· Quirinus, zo. 2 above. Vzminalis is derived from vimina (osiers),
of which there were large quantities in this region.

The Esquiline formed one of the four regiones into which Servius
(cf. 43. 13) was believed to have divided the city. The name Esquiliae
(originally Exquiliae) is 'generally taken to indicate ‘out-district,’
‘suburb,' whose inhabitants were esquilini ‘outlanderS,' i.e. not in-
quilini. “ ’

22 atcere] This term came to denote both mound a-nd ditch. In the
case of the ‘Servian ' fortifications it applies especially to that portion,
about a mile long, which ran over the plateau to the N.E., the side on
which the city was best defended by nature.

ancient custom, by which a plough was driven, in the direction of the
su'n's course, round the circuit of a proposed town z the furrow so made
marked the ditch, the up·turned clods the line os wall inside it. Varro
says (L. L. v. 143) terram unde exsculpsnantfhssamvocabant et introrsus
iactam murum .· post ea qui fiebat orbis, ‚urbis principium, qui quod erat
post murum, postmoerium dictum, coque nuspa-ia urbana finiuntur.

·. muto] The date of the ‘Servian’ wall now remaining is 'much
disputed: perhaps it is of two periods (1) of the second half of the sixth
