, p CHAPTER XXXV. -
3 §1- comma creando] ,dat—QQ Livy

assumes that Ancus was now dead, and that the process of electing
a successor (i. e the interregnum, see c. 17) had already reached the
stage at which the populus, assembled in comitia curtata, designated a
king, subject to the ratification of the patres: cf. 17. 9 and 10, αα. 1,
32. 1.

where a negative notion is remotely represented, if at all, by non

preceding. The meaning here seems to' be ‘at which one could have

expressed indignation or surprise ’ (but one cannot as thing· are).

posset] reproduces the actual phrase and tense of the or. recta.
