XLIII] NOTES 179

Military equipment‚ if the panoply of the Greek or Graeco-Etruscan
man-at·arms was to be encountered in the field, involved a considerable
outlay‚ which none but wealthy citivens could afford τ and it was logical
therefore to base the new qualification and liability for service upon
a property-valnation. ζ

The subjoined plan indicates the distribution and rating of units, as
attributed to Servius Tullius.

From the military point of view, the centuries were ‘ establishments '
which contributed each its quota to make up the total required at each
levy: and the four districts contributed, from the numbers in each
century and clasS, a quarter of the levy. The total force available was
four legions, two of seniores and two of funebres ε and each legion was
drawn up in a phalanx of Dorian pattem, a close-order formation of
six ranks, 500 in each, with 1200 light-armed troops on the flanks or in
rear, and 300 cavalry. The first three classes composed the phalanx,
but in what proportions is disputed: the fourth claSS, according to the
equipment assigned to it by Dionysius, seems to have been used either
as a supernumerary rank if required, or as skirmishers (rorarii) τ the fifth
class fought only with missiles. The association of the centuries of
fabri with the first or second class is obviously due to the frequent need
of such artificers for the repair of arms and armour z and the quota of
fabri required in each levy would depend immediately on the proportion
of juniores called out for active service in the first two classes· The
association of the trumpeters (by Dionysius) with the fourth class
seems to suggest that they also had definite duties to perform with the
phalanx, the movements of which might well depend upon regular
trumpet-calls.

The scales of property-qualifications given by Livy and Dionysius
involve difficulties which have long exercised the ingenuity of scholam,

but have never been—perhaps cannot be—completely solved. ’ It · is
clear that the various ratings—centum milia aer-125, and the rest—are
based on a more definite system of monetary values than is believed -
to have been in existence in Rome under the kingS.

It is generally agreed that pieees of copper or bronze (aes) were in
use from 1000 B.c. as the lowest units of reckoning in a system of
which the ox was the highest unit, and the sheep the intermediate unit:
these piee'es were called asses, and were reckoned by bulk (aes rude), not
even by weight, in' the first stage. It may be admitted, on the authority
of Timaeus, Pliny (H. N. xxxnl. 3. 13) and Festus (s.v.· infra
censum p. 113 Manet), thatin the reign of Servius Tullius, i-e. towards
