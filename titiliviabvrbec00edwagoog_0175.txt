with strips of goat-skin all the women who came in their way. 1t is
not clear in honour of what god these rites were performed ε the name
Inuus, mentioned below by Livy, is probably one epithet of that spirit
who reappears as Faunus, Silvanus and Pan. The significance of the
ceremony seems to have been a renewal of life by the life-blood of ⁴
sacrifice, and by the wearing of the skin os the victims: the last act, in
which the Luperci (or creppi, as they were commonly called) ran a
regular course round the Palatine, i.e. the pomerium or boundaryv of
the city, was meant to be both a purification and a fertilisation. The .
two guilds of Luperci <like the Salii: see n. on 20. 4) belonged to
two separate communitieS‚ subsequently united. See F owlen Roman
Festivals, pp. gro—321.

Luper-eal hoe minse lud-iorum] This may be translated in two
ways : (t) ⁸ our festival of the Lupercalia was celebrated,' hocssludz‘oe-um
being in apposition to Lupercal: (2)' ‘our Lupercalia existed as a
festival.’ Livy is speaking of his own day (Σοί) ; the feast lasted on till
the end of the 5th century of our era. ludicrum ε the word is especially
appropriate here for a ⁴ festival ² where the sportive character (per lusum
atque lasciviam) is so- remarkable: cf. xxvln. 7. ¹4 Olympiorum '
sollemne ludicrum.

Pallanteo] The Greek form is Παλλάντιον or Παλάντιονε its reputed
founder was Pallas son of Lycaon. This fanciful derivation of Palatium
is a link in the chain which connects Arcadia with the origins of Rome ε ’
the word is probably derived from a root pa ‘ protect ' (cf. Pales), and
so = ‘ a'fenced place.'

ἕ 8. Euandnzm] The story of Evander, and the resemblance
between the Arcadian Λύκαια, or rites of Pan Lycaeus, and the
Lupercalia, give support to the theory of , a Pelasgian settlement in
Latium. The mother of Evander, Carmenta (7. 9), is a being un—
mistakably Italian, connected in all probability with the group of
primitive spirits of which Mars and Faunus are the dominant types.

ex οο genere] i.e. from the stock of Pallanteum.

· tempe-tatanus] ‘ages’: so again in the singular in 18. ις 3ο.. 43
36. 33 56. 6. The plural is not so used by Cicero ε it occurs in Plautus,
and Sallust.

tenuerit loca] ⁴ was lorcl of those quarterS.’

sollemne] ‘ ceremony ἐ the word originally means ‘ annual,' and
thence passes naturally to ‘ custom’ and ‘rite.’

- instituisse] The word has here a double government (1) sollemne„

(2) ut. . ‚currerent
