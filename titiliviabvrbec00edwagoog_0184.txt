11 apparitores] Cf. 40. 53 48. 4² this word (from apparea, ‘attend ’)
denotes the free attendants of Roman officiaIS, as opposed to servi
publeci. The apparitores were paid and privileged: they were divided
into five classes or corporations—scribae, accensi, lictores, viatores,
praecones.

also was derived’ (in the first case).
14 duodecim populis] The following are supposed to have been¹ the
twelve ‘communities’ of Etruria proper: Volaterrae, Arretium, Cortona,
Perusia, Clusium, Rusellae, Vetulonia, Volsinii, Volci, Tarquinii, Caere,
