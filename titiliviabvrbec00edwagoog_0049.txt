early history os Italy ¹. Such critics believe that the connection
between Tarquins and Etruria is due to the identity of their
name and that of the Etruscan city, is in fact an etymological
myth which serves to explain the introduction into the Roman
state of certain emblemS‚ ceremonieS‚ and material improve-
ments generally believed to have come from Etruria& lt is
urged that, if the T arquins were Etruscan in origin and sympathy,
the elder T arquin would scarcely be represented in tradition as
defeating the Etruscans in two pitched battles and receiving
recognition as supreme lord of the twelve cities of Etruria; and
the second Tarquin as having continued the supremacy of Rome
over Etruria, which Servius Tullius had already confirmed⁸.
But jealousy among Etruscan chieftains might account for such
warfare, and perhaps it is simplest to suppose that just as there are
duplicate traditions—Greek and Latin —for the events preceding
the foundation of Rome, so there are duplicate traditions—
Etruscan and Latin—for the T arquin period ⁴. The official
account, given by Livy, is in both cases a contamination.

The effect of Etruscan domination on Roman religion is to
be seen in the introduction of definite images—e.g. of the
Etruscan trinity, Jupiter (Tinia)‚ Juno,and Minerva—into temples
and ritual⁶. But this anthropomorphism was not original in the
Etruscans : they owed it to Greek influences‚ and ‘ there is no real
trace in Italy of an indigenous iconie representation of Jupiter⁶.’
The new Jupiter of the Capitoline became the central figure of
the Roman Pantheon. In the state likewise the Tarquins typified
a greater emphasis on the personality of the sovereign—-in abso-
lute action and disregard of constitutional limitations at home,
in a definite claim to the primacy of Latium outside, supported

⁴ Evidence of such parallel traditions is to be seen in the equation
of Tanaquil and Gaia Caecilia, and of Mastarna and Servius Tullius.
