22 5 ¹7. ad stabula] ‘ in his cottage.'

Larentiae] i.e. Acca Larentia (Ρ ‘ mother of the Lares’). In all the
most ancient cults of Italy the nature of the deity is veiled in divers
names and epithets: thus Acca Larentia was one variety of the Dea
Dia worshipped by the Arval Brethren—a guild probably as old as the
state itself. Here she seems to be a sort of Fauna, or feminine to
Faunus : in another aspect she is the she-wolf itself. The sinister sense
of lupa (‘ harlot ’) which Livy gives in the rationalising view of the next
sentence found some justification in the legend of an amour between
Acca Larentia and Hercules. It is not certain how the she-wolf came
into the tale—as it did at least as early as 296 lma—whether as the
sacred animal of Mars, the Palatine god, or because of the Lupercal,
or otherwise. See Introduction, 5 3.

23 vulgato eorporo] ‘ because she made herself common property) .

26 5 Β. neo in stabuli-...ma ‘ no sluggards in the cottage or with
the cattle.’

29 5 0. subsistere] ‘stand up to’—a Livian word, cf. ιχ. 31. 6 prae·
potentem armis Romanum subsistere: Gk ὑφιστάναι.

31 nerlu. ae iocos] ‘ tasks and sports’= ‘grave moods and gay?
ludicrum in the next chapter seems to be an instance of the latter,
while the former may allude to the raids and the plot against the
king. .

it be a gloss.

Lupercal] This word denotes (1) a place—the grotto at the foot
(W.) of the Palatine, where tradition set the sacred fig-tree of the
Twins: (2) as here, a festival, i. e. the Lupercalia, celebrated in historical
times on 15 February. The name Lupercal seems to be made up of
lupus and arcere, so = ‘ wolf-fence,’ but whether this refers to a
wolf-stronghold or to a sending off of wolves is not clear, though we
may believe there is some connection with the wolf of Mars. The
festival may have taken its title from the spot, or from the celebrantS‚
called Luperci ε the creation of a deity Lupercus is of later date. The
festival was of extreme antiquity, probably pre-Roman. First of all
goats and a dog were sacrificed‚ and sacred cakes were offered 2 next,
two youths of rank were smeared on the forehead with blood, and
wiped with wool ε then, clad only in the skins of the goats, they feasted ε
and last1y‚ they and their companies ran round the Palatine, striking
