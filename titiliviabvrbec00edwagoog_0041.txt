by Act II (Numa Pompilius). It is a transition from the
Palatine to the Septimontium and beyond.

Itis interesting to observe‚ in the case of Numa as almost
everywhere else in the regal history, the existence of duplica-te
tradition5‚ often contaminated. Livy sayS, but says only ·to
disprove in passing, that Pythagoras was thought by some to
have been the source of Numa's trainin g in ius divinum atque
humanum : and, then, a little later, he attributes the whole of it
to the goddess Egeria. Here on the one hand we may see a
piece of Greek grafting, more reckless than usual ; on the other
hand, an incidental reference to the close connection between
the King of the State and the Queen of the Wood, which seems
to underlie the Latin idea of kingship. 1f it was proper for the
king to be in intimate relationship‚ to be ritually wedded, with
such a queen, was not that marriage the proper source of true
ritual for the new state? Ancient ritual depends for its efficacy
on a knowledge of the sun and moon in their courses: the
nominal founder of Roman religious observance must therefore
be responsible also sor the calendar. ln the priestly offices of
his creation the patrician element is clearly marked. He
himself performed, among other ritual dutieS, those of the
flamen Dialisl, and evidently regarded them as sacra regiae
victis. The other two flamines belong to gods—Mars and
Quirinus—whom Varro regards as Sabine. The three flamines
and the Salii were always patricians; the Vestal virgins (an
institution derived by Livy from Alba, that is to say, of Latin
origin, and doubtless far older than ‘ Numa‚' as is already
implied in the legend of Rea Silvia, the Vestal mother of
Romulus and Remus) were certainly of pure patrician birth so
long as it was possible to insist on this qualification.

In the cult of Fides, to be celebrated with peculiar care by
the flamines, Livy records the first instance of the worship of an
abstract idea in and for itself. This is probably later in ritual

¹ i.e.‚ in all probability, of Ianus: see note on 19. α. The Ianus
haym, the famous arch in the Forum, is probably one of the gates of
the Septimontium.
