veneramus...11ttorarum] ‘ he won respect sor the wonderful gift
of letters.’ So Dionysius (1. 33. 4) attributes the introduction of
letters into Italy to the Arcadian colonists. The mother alphabet os
ancient Italy was probably like that of Euboea, and thus the old Italian
scripts are commonly called Chalcidian. Perhaps Cumae (where the
Chalcidian type obtained) may have been one of the original points of
connection between Greece and Italy in this respect. But it is possible
to believe that the gift of letters to Italy came through Pelasgian settle-
ments (e.g. of Caere, see note on c. 1. 3 above), independently os

'Chalcidian colonists. Cf. W. Ridgeway, Early Age qs Graece, vol. 1.

to be seen, the first dating before, the second in most cases aster, the

Superbus), whither they may have·come from Erythrae, the traditional
home os prophecy.
