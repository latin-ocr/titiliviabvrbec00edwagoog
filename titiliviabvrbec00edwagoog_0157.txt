111 ξ 2] NOTES ·89

19- quemcumque] It was customary in Roman prayer to avoid all·
possible offence by giving a deity all his titles (e. g. Matutine pater, seu
Iane libentius audis), and adding even then some such phrase as aut
quocumque alio nomine riae vocaris-z the same idea seems to be present
in Aesch. Ag. 160 Ζεύς, ὅστις ποτ’ ἐστίν, εἰ τόδ’ αὐτῷ φίλον κεκλημένῳ.
Here Livy follows the custom‚ giving Aeneas the benefit of the generali·
sation: moreover PauluS, p. 106, sayS‚ Indigetes di, quorum nominat-
vulgum· non licet.

,20 super Numicum] ‘beyond the N.,' i. e. on the further side from
Rome, on which Lavinium was situated. According to one tradition,
Aeneas fell into the Numicus (Numicius) in his ssight from MezentiuS,
and Ascanius slew the latter in revenge.

21 Iovem Ῑιιωςοωπι] The word Indigrs means ‘local ' in abode or
activity, ἐπιχώριος, χθόνιος z so Dionysius (1. 64) says that the inscription
in this case ran πατρὸς θεοῦ χθονίου. As Iuppiter Indiges, Pater Indiges,
or Deus Indiges (and afterwards Aeneas Indcges also), Aeneas became

closely connected with the ancient sanctuary of Latin unity, the home of
the Penates at Lavinium.

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ. ,

ᾧ) 5 1. imperio] For the dat., expressing remote object, cf. 11. 5. 3
seges matura messi ς Hor. Od. 1. 23. η tempestiva viro.

25 tanta...orat] explains muliebri, and gives a reason for the whole
sentence: cf. Praef. 1 1 adeo.

26 puero stetit] ‘ was assured to the lad ἐ so Virg. Aen. Ι. 268 dum res
stetit Ilia regno.

Θ ὅ 2. quis...pro certo adfirmet Ρ] Hypothetical subjunctive, Q-
tasis being understood. The same phrase occurs again in xxvn. ι. 13:
it expresses the attitude adopted by Livy in the Preface (5 6).

29 comes inde] For the order cf. 6. 1 caedem deinceps tyranni.

30 Iulum] cs. Virg. Aen. 1. 267-8 at puer Ascanius, cui nunc cognomen
Iulo additur—Ilus erat, dum res stetit Ilia regno. Iulus probably means ³
‘little Jupiter ’ ; and the traditional connection of the Julii with Iulus is
supported by their family worship of Veiovis (the little Jupiter). Be-
tween Iulus and Silvius (see ἕ 6) there waS, according to one tradition,
a division of prerogativae, Iulus being invested with the chief priesthood.
(Cf. Frazer‚ Early Histmy ofthe Kingsltip, p. τοο.) ⁴

eundem] A certain antithesis lies hidden here: ‘whom as Iulus,
though one and the same.’ cf. Aurelius Victor, Orig. Gent. Rom. 1v. 7
hunc Faunum plerique eundem Silvanum a silvis esse dixerunt.
