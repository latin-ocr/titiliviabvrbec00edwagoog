200 LI V Y. I [2xtvnr ξ 6

20 ἕο. m inan] See n. on 47· 5.

22 ad nummum cupi-lum vicum] summum=‘ at the highest part of ’
a sloping street. Caprium is explained by Varro (L. L. v. 159) as
connected with a Sabine occupatiori: nam cuprum Sabine bonmm. It
would· thus be named in direct contrast to the Sceleratus Vicus. The
spelling Cyprium is surely incorrect in a word not derived from the
Greek ε and we know that there was an old Italian deity named Cupra
(more or less identical with Juno) who might well give her name to a vicus.

23 mm] a· Greek form«, due probably to the fact that Livy is using
a Greek authority.

nuper ruit] A sacellum Dianae in Caeliculo had been removed by
L. Piso in Cicero’s day (cf. Cic. de Har-usp. Resp. μὴ·4 but·- this can
scarcely be identified with a Dianium on the Esquiline, unless Livy's
topography.. is altogether faulty. The sentence ubi...fia‘t is inserted
parenthetically by Livy, and is independent of its context.

fimena] ‘ as she turned‚’ i-e. bade the driver turn.

in Vrbium clivum] This incline seems to have led up the western
slope of the Oppian spur, and so to the platoeu of the. Esquiline.
The meaning of Vrbius is doubtful: some scholars connect it with,
or. correct it into, Virbius, a King of the Wood, coupled with Diana
at Aricia and thus also here in Rome.

24 in collem raqufflmum] This adjectival form occurs nowhere else,
and Madvig accordingly emends to Esquiliarum. On the. Esquiliae,
as we were told in 44. 3, Servius had built his palace, perhaps as a kind
of fottress: cf. Dion. Hal. Ν. 13 ἐν τῷ κρατίστῳ τῆς Ἰσκυλίας τόπῳ.

27 5 ¹2. ΜΝ] sc. sactum esse.

monumento] The name of the street- was evidence of a crime, but
not necessarily of this crime, with which it may have been connected·
subsequently3 cf. 36. 5, 45. 4.

28 Sceleratum vicum] The ‘ Street of Crime’ is probably identical
with. the Vrbius Clivus.

29 menn] ‘ maddened’: so ferox means ‘ emboldened ² in ²3· 4. The
adjective in such cases is no. mere epithet‚.but has a participial. force : cf.
insen, ⁵4· ἃ.

turus] ‘ avenging spirits,’ a touch os Greek tragedy applied· to a
Latin legendz cf. 59. 13·

31 sanguimfl ac caedis paternae] ‘the blood of her murder-ed father’3

or, is caedis means ‘gore’ (cf. CatulluS‚ 64. 181 respoems fraterna

caede, Prop. 11. 8, 34 sparsae caede comae) the phrase emphasizes a
single notion, ‘her father’ s life· blood?
