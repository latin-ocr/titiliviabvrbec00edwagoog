THE PREFACE.

'1³ Aualysisz (ς ι) Wul my history prove worth the mak2·ng?' J know
not. (ἐς 2, 3) Among rivals so numerous ana' so eminent, my name
may be overshadowed and obscured; but what matter, if, in this labour
of love, I may further the history of the Imperial Nation ἓ (ἓ 4) It is
true that the retrospect of seven centuries is an infinite task, and uu-
attractive to many a modern readers (ς 5) yet for myself it will bring
its own reward in diverting attention from the troubles of to-day.

(ἕ 6) Prehistoris traditions I do not propose to support or to subvert :
(ἕ 7) remote antiquity must be allowed a certain poetic licence, and the
martial glory eff the Imperial Nation may well justtjj‘ a pedigree that
dates from Mars. (55 8, 9) But, opinions apart, I would invite the
student to contemplate the men and the mea-sures of our Imperial history,
the transition from the strictness of the past to the laxity ‘ff tlte present,-
(ἓ ιο) for History teaches by types of good and ill. (ἐξ 11, η) My
experience tells me that tlte Roman state has avoided longer than tlte
rest those evils of luxury and extravagnnce which waste its energia·
to·day. But mine be no key-note of complaint: (ἕ 13) rather let me
begin my task with prayers to heaven fhr success.

The first paragraph sets forth the litet-ary and political environment
of the author, the second, his historical attitude. The tone is extremely
modest throughout, free at once from pedantry, flattery‚ and partisan·
ship. See the Introduction, ἐξ 1, 2.
