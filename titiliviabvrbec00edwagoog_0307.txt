l lta. racto..opus esse] ‘they needs must do so, and with speed':
oratio obliqua, as part of the message. This construction of the perf.
part. with opus is probably colloquial: it occurs frequently in Plautus
and Terence.

21 ἓ ο. Valerio Volesi fillo] Volesus or Volusus seems to be a
collateral form (cf. Clausus and Claudius) of Valerius ε its presence here
may serve to indicate the antiquity—perhaps the Sabine origin—of the
Valerii. P. Valerius became Publicola soon after this (see 11. 8. α) t and
the family is associated ab initio with the liberty of the ,citizens-

2 3 conventusl‘metss ‘confronted.'

24 suorum] See note on 7. 1 sua.

25 5 ’1. ‘satin salve ν’] With the adverb salve some word such as agir,
agitur is to be supplied. salvi refers at once to health and to chastity.
‘ Is all well with thee ?' ‘ N ay, how can it be well with a woman...?’

2 ab muta] ‘from the victim of violence‚' ‘ stom a helpless woman)
mentem peccare] mentem is the emphatic word: ‘sin is of the mind,
not of the body, and where there has been no previous intention, there
is no guilt.'
4 ὅ 10. vos videritis] perf. subj„ ‘it shall be for you to see’: so
ι Virg. Aen. x. 743 nunc morere: at de mc divom pater atque hominum

y rex viderim and 2 3. 8 above fuerit.

 

ἕ 12. eum] For this resumptive use cf. 19. 1 urbem...eam, 49. 9 .

ei Mamilio.
8 lu vulnus] ‘over the wound.’
conclamat] It was the custom after death and before burial to call
y often and aloud (conclamare) the name of the departed (cf. 26. α). Here

in the next sentence by illis luctu occupatis.

Ι CHAPTER LIX.

12 ἕ 1.. ante...in1uriam] ‘until a prince did outrage it'—-the phrase
