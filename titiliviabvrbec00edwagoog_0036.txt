xxx LIVY. I

though the form of the deity was vague, the ritual of service
was most exact; and in such ritual one of the earliest features
was the application of a suitable epithet (eg. Feretrius) to the
object of worship, and thus it is that many of the earlier titles of
Roman deities are adjectiveS. We may say that in Roman worship
the adjective precedes the noun, in time and in importance.

Is such was the general character of Roman religion in the
age of RomuluS, what is the place of a cult of Hercules therein—
a cult, ton, instituted (as Livy says in c. 7) by Evander, and
celebrated Graeco ritu? The explanation seems to be twofold.
On the one hand we know that Stesichorus of Himera (whose
part in the connection of Aeneas with Italy has been mentioned in
ξ 3), wrote a Geryonid‚ in which were set forth the wanderings of
Heracles in the West‚ and that Timaeus spoke of his passage
through Campania. Heracles waS, then, one of the characters
in the genealogy of Rome which was framed by Hellenic
authors: his legend was older in Latium than that of Romulus
himself, and he found his proper place by Evander’s side as
the mythical opponent of Cacusl. On the other hand (as is
stated in the note on c. 7. 3), we may regard the cult of
‘ Hercules' here as a native one, in which the spirit of the male
genius (the numen of virility), the lord of oathS, was worshipped
with harvest offerings and a harvest supper at an altar set in
the pasturing ground of the Palatine down by the Tiber, but
within the pomerium. I n any case, the name ‘ Hercules ' became
the Latin counterpart of ‘ HeracleS,’ whose cult was perhaps
introduced in the age which we call ‘ Servius Tullius' (see ξ 7
below): but the primeval elements were not exterminated.
the god Hercules and the Graecus n‘tus did not entirely

supplant the numen.
The immediate association os Titus Tatius and his Sabines

with Romulus in Livy's account is somewhat misleading, for it
seems to suggest that the first expansion of the Palatine settle-
ment was on the Capitoline-Quirinal side, the traditional
abode of the Sabines; but it is generally believed, both on
