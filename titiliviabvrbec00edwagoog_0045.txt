Palatina. The order of the regions is somewhat surprising: we
do not expect to find the Suburana, which roughly corresponded
to the Caelian mount, put first, and the Palatine last. Yet the
tradition¹ that Tullus Hostilius set his regia on the Caelian, to
make that district attractive to settlerS, seems to indicate that
some formal prominence may have been attached to this quarter
at such a stage as we are describing. The typical festival of the
F our Regions was that connected with the sacraria Argeorum
(of which Varro ² says there were 27) and the pons sublicius: and
though it may have been introduced considerably after the regal
period, its stations help to indicate the pomerium of the Four
Regions (see the plan of Rome), which served also for the
Servian city. ι ·

The story of Tullus and Ancus may be taken as the typical
expression of a period in which the kingly power, firmly es-
tablished at Rome itself, began to assert itsels over the surrounding
district: imperium, in other words, begins to signify not only
authority at home, but sovereignty and empire abroad³. The
trial of Horatius for the slaying of his sister, which serves to
introduce the right of provocatio (for it is the usual plan of Livy
to found an institution upon a particular instance), illustrates
authority at home: the demolition of Alba, and the formalities
for declaring war and making a treaty, illustrate authority
abroad. This, then, is a convenient point at which to take a
brief survey of the relations between Rome and her Latin neigh-
bourS.

In the first stages the small communities in the plain of
Latium, for all the keenness of cousinly rivalry, were conscious
still of cousinship, not shared with Etruscans or Sabines.
They began to accept a common worship, and by an annual
festival to cernent their relationship3 and the area of their league
extended north to Fidenae, east to Gabii, south to Ardea and
perhaps to Suessa Pometia4. Lavinium, with its ancient cult of
