and in Livfs own day Augustus made his daughter aud granddaughters
attend to the same (cf. Suet. Aug. 64. 4). So, in the Proverbs, xxxl.

neuter adjective, with a genitive dependent on it in a partitive or quasi-
partitive sense, is found with plurals in Lucretius and the Augustan

plural), but Livy has it at every turn, e.g. v. 4¹· 2 medae'o aodimn eburneis
sellis sedere, 11. 33. 7 in proximo urbis, XXVI. 40. 9 in modia urbis ac
forum, Vl. 32. 6 ad subita belli.
