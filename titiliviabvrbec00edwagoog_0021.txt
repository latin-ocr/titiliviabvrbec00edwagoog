Roman state, it is not surprising that others turned their attention
to its history and antiquitieS. Many men, in their enforced
leisure under the new rule, tried to write the record of their own
recent experiences in the civil wars; but for others the study—
or we may almost call it the cult-—of antiquity, with the
abundant materials now available, seemed to be more attractive
and less contentious. And indeed, the time was peculiarly
favourable for a survey os the whole history os Rome and a
description of its dramatic unity. The historiari might still
express, without sear of imperial displeasure, his appreciation
of the work and worth os the great Republicans. The time of
toleration had not yet passed away, and it was not necessary

It was in literary surroundings of this character that Titus
Livius of Patavium set himself to compose the history os
Rome, from the first-beginnings down to his own times. In
what spirit he took up his pen let his own Preface bear
witness· He begins¹ by doubting the probable value of his
history; his subject is infinite in itself, and may be unattractive

oblivion his own name and fame, if he may help the history of
Imperial Rome, which possesseS, in the glory of its antiquity,
in the richness of its example5‚ and in the potency of its
philosophy, a fascination that is unique and irresistible. With
the enthusiasm of a patriot‚ Livy could admire the Imperial City,
and the men who had made her such3 with the independence
of a republican, he could declare her virtues, and denounce her
vices· Yet for all this he brought the spirit of the Augustan
age into the whole os his work, and his ⁸ canonisation of Rome’
(as a modern critic² has aptly- termed it)was-11ke the Aeneid
of Virgil--a service to the Principate which no one understood
or appreciated better than the Princeps himself. Augustus was
wise enough to discern the loyal subject in the avowed republican,
