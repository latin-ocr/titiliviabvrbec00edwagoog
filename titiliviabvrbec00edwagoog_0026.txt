xx LIVY. I

and described them in general terms‚ as an artist might indi-
cate, by a few sweeping strokeS, the outlines os a subJect which
it would take a life-time to fill in. Livy was no archaeologist,
and thus he felt no desire to investigate sources of information
other th'an those which literature afforded: he could even leave
unread an inscription, close at hand in Rome, which would have
saved him from the necessity of stating two alternatives from
his authorities¹. Nor did he exercise any critical judgment of
events: and on constitutional questions his words are still the
texts of controversy. He was no traveller, like HerodotuS‚
PolybiuS, and Diodorus: no chronologer, no topographer, no
tactician. He had, in fact, no scientific qualifications to write
history. We can see from his Preface that he has a certain
distrust of his own powerS‚ which was not unnatural when he
was immediately confronted with that crux criticorum, the
origins of Rome: but he had what professed critics too
frequently lack, a sense os selection, an intuition sometimes
amounting almost to clairvoyance, a ‘divination of the truth²,’
which is better than a dull record of events», but which falls sar
short of the Truth itself. He was a true Roman at heart, and
he wrote for Romans their own record; and thus it is that while
we can read through Thucydides the canon of history, we learn

in Livy the character of Rome³.

And nowhere more clearly than in the speeches, which
naturally afford him the opportunity most suited to his geniuS‚

'⁴ does he express the dominant idea of his political philosophy—-

‘the decline and fall' os Roman character. The ancient critics ,
were inclined to regard the speeches as the best part os his'work:
yet he probably did not insert them merely to satisfy a sense of
rhetoric, for doubtless there were speeches in the annalists whom
he followed, and his own merit here as elsewhere consists *chiefly
of an improvement in form and language. ln Book 1, if .we
leave out of consideration short utterances which serve as

ingeniorum aestimator.
