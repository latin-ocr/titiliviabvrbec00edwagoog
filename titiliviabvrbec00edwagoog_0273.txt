xmn 5 8] NOTES 185

in 5 8 as additional to the three mentioned here, Livfs total is 194, an
even, and therefore unlikely, number.

Various solutions of the difficulty have been suggested. It should be
remembered first that accensi may be considered (a) as a substantive, =

‘supernumeraries,' intended to replace casualties ; (b) as a participle, =
‘ rated with‚’ ⁸ reckoned among.' ,

(ι) It is thought that the una centuria of 5 8 refers again to the
accemi, and thus identifies these with the proletarii, as the body of
citizens without rating came to be called, in distinction from the name
assidui, applied to the equites and the five classes3

(α) accensi may be taken as a participle, and duas read sor tres (II
for III) ;

(3) accensi may be taken as a substantive, and duas read for tres ;
i. e. corniciam tubicinesque may have formed one century (they formed oue
collegium in later days) 3

(4) accensis...duas may be read; i.e. the term accensi is applied
to the fifth clasS, not -to the proletarii (the una centuria os 5 8).

For the term tubicines in this connection Cicero has the older word
liticines (i.e. clarion-players). The tuba was straight, the lituus curved
at the bell-end, the cornu semicircular.

1 1 5 8. undecim milibus] ‘ at 11,ooo ’ : ablative as os price.
Dionysius says οἷς ἐντὸς ,εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε μνῶν ἀχρὶ δώδεκα, καὶ ἡμίσους -
μνῶν ὁ βίος ἦν, i.e. from less than 25,0oo asses to 12,5oo.,

1 2 hoe minor census] ‘ the rating below this ' (hoc), i.e. the proletarii
(ἄποροι in Dionysius).

multitudinem] ‘ population': so in c. 29. 1, 33. 1.

1 3 indo]= ex ea.

immunis mffltla] ⁶ exempt from military duty ' τ Dionysius says
more explicitly στρατείας τ’ ἀπέλυσε καὶ πάσης εἰσφορᾶς ἐποίησεν
ἀτελεῖς. immunis has here its literal meaning ‘ that performs no duty ’
or ‘ pays no tax ’ (ἀτελής, ἀνείὲνφορος), and so ‘ exempt.’ The ablative
expresses separation3 Livy's use of the case for this purpose, without a
preposition‚ is considerably freer than that os Cicero and Caesar.

¹4 ornato] ‘equipped,' ‘accoutred,' i.e. in the scheme of Servius now
described, not as yet in actual fact.

15 ex mimofibue...oenturlu] i.e. he enrolled (scripsit for consempsit)
ια centuries of knights from among the leading citizens of first-class
rating (Dionysius says ἐκ τῶν ἐχόντων τὸ μέγιστον τίμημα, καὶ κατὰ γένος
ἐπιφανῶν). It would seem that this part of the cavalry was recruited in
conformity to the general scheme of property-qualification, while the
