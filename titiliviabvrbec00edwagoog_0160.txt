80 LI V Y. J [Praefi § 3

10 nobilitato] ‘ renown,’ ⁶ distinction ’-of birth or authorship.
officient] ‘ obstruct,' ‘ obliterate ἐ cf. Cic. Tusc. D. v. 3²· 92
qffecetfat videlieet apricanti.

11 §⁴- τοῦ] ‘ my subject ’3 in other wordS, the Roman Empire‚ to
which the two relative clauses seem properly to refer.

ot] answered by et legentium...

immensi] ‘infinite‚’ ‘boundless,’ in its literal sense, for Livy cannot
soresee the extent to which his work will be developed. .

ut quae...ropetatur] ‘ implying as it does a retrospect of more than
seven centuries’ The verb repetere means ‘ go back to seek‚’ and so
‘trace from the beginning’ (so again in 1. 20 below): the English word
‘research’ is similar. ut (like quippe, utpote) gives a personal emphasis
to the reason expressed by the relative clause3 cf. 1. 5 ut quibus...
superesset.

12 et quae] The relative pronoun is repeated, to indicate a different
aspect of the subject—the growthof the Empire. The transition may
be thus expressed ε ‘wherein a state, starting from slender beginnings,
has grown until it is oppressed by its own immensity.'

15 · origines] ‘element5‚’ ‘genesis.' Cato’s work upon the early history
of -the Italian cities was so called3 cf. Cic. Planc. 27. 66 populi orig-ines.-
libenter mim etiam verbo utor Catonis. proxima ommium, ‘the next
stages.’

16* . festinantibus ad haec nova] ‘as they hurry on to these modern
question3‚’ i.e. the civil wars, iam pridem probably goes with con·
ficiunt; i.e. the troubles are still continuing, or scarcely over. The
Preface thus seems to be a little earlier than the date of Book 1. (i.e.
:37-225 -B.c.), as indicated by events mentioned in c. 19. 3 (see note).
Not a few historians of the early Augustan age wrote monographs on
certain characters and aspects of their own times, or memoirs of their
own ,careerS, and these works must osten have caused a renewal of
party feelings. From these reminiscences Livy seeks to dissociate
himself by the study of Roman antiquity.

19 ἓ 6. tot per annos] More than 20, if we regard Caesar’s mvasion
of Italy in 49 Β. c. as the starting- point, and 28—7 Β. c. as the date of
this Preface.

πο dum prisea...repeto] i.e. dum prisca illa (as opposed to haec nova)
tota mente repeto, ‘ in· a whole-hearted study of that glorious past)

21 curae] ‘concern’ i.e. ‘ulterior motive‚’ ‘ partisanship'3 alluding
to the attitude of contemporary writers: see n. on l. 16 above.

22 posset] The tense refers„ to an anxiety which ‘ might have been,’
