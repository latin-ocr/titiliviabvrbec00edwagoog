limited by annual tenure and by senatorial advice. That is the
consulship as we know it in historical times : but this office can
scarcely have leapt into being fully developed. ’ There is some-
thing to be· said for the view which regards the consulship as
the cause, and not the effect, of the end of the monarchy1. The
old name of the consuIS, praetores, indicates military leaders 3
and it is not impossible that there may have been more than
two at first, for three would naturally be required for the con-
tingents supplied by TitienseS, Ramnenses and Luceres. A
reconstruction of the military establishment, on a basis of two
legionS‚ with two praetores to command in the field, may have
'left the third praetor in charge of civil jurisdiction at home—
praetor urbanus, in fact. A gradual advance of such officers
from a subordinate position under a monarch to independence
and supreme imperium under a republic is as intelligible as a
gradual diminution of kingly prerogative until the rex is no more
than a rex sacrorum (but always a patrician), the counterpart
“ of the King-Archon at Athens· The advance of the military
commander, and the decline of the priest-king, are alike natural
and necessary in an age of conflict such as that through which
the Roman state must have passed in the fifth and fourth
centuries B.C. The king, then, did not die: but the patres
gradually effected the transfer of the imperium—which, in
irresponsible hands, as the Tarquins had shown, might endanger
their own position in the state—to magistrates whose limited
tenure of office was a reminder and a guarantee of responsibility.
And conversely, when any consul or consular showed a tendency
in after years to overstep the prescribed limus, even though it
were as a benefactor to the state, or at any rate to the plebeiam,
he was accused by the patres of aiming at the kingship: so that
rex and its cognates became identified in the mind of good
republicans with all that was absolute and tyrannicalss.
