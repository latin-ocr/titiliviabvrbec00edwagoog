8 militae] ‘accredited‚’ ‘ accepted? It is possible that in this
departure and deification of Romulus, as in the decease os Aeneas
(c. 2. 6) and the destruction of Tullus Hostilius (c. 31. 8), we
have evidences of the close connection between the kingship and
Jupiter, the god of the sky, of the thunder, and of the oak. As
Quirinus, if we derive it from the same root as quercus, Romulus was
in effect the oak god. Cf. A. Β. Cook, ⁸ Zeus, Jupiter, ,and the ›oak‚'
Classical Review, xviii. (1904), pp. 368 foll.; Frazer‚ op. cit. p. 206.

ovid (Fasti, 11. 477—480) gives the three usual explanations of the
name: sive quod hasta curis priscis est detta Sabinis, bellicus a telo venit
in astra deus: sive ¹suo regi nomen posuere Quirites ,· seu quia Romanis
iunxerat ille Cures. Quirinus is held to be a Sabine deity by Varro;
and it is noteworthy that his flamen, down to imperial times, must needs
be a Patrician. If Quirinus is derived from Cures, the form may be
due to Plebeian pronunciationz sor the Greek writers transliterate it as
Κύρινος. See Prof. W. Ridgeway's paper‚ Wlw were the Romans ? read
before the Britisb Academy on 24 April, 1907.

With the mythioel exception of Romulus the Romans raised none
of their heroes to 'divine estate until the latter end os the Republic,
when Greek and Oriental notions began to possess the minds os all
classes. When Livy wrote this account of the apotheosis of Romulus,

Julius Caesar had been deified, and Augustus was receiving divine .

honours at Rome and abroad.

14 ἓ 8. ante mon] This may be taken in two ways: (ι) ‘ more than
other (kings)‚' referring to Romulus: (α) ‘to the sympathies of soldierS,
far more than otherS,' where it stands for magis quam aliorum (animis).
The character described suits Julius Caesar as well as Romulus: possibly
Livy had the former in his mind.

regular adjuncts of the Greek tyrant, the body-guard granted by his
supporters to protect him against politica! opponents.
