1 9 ' Romae] is probably connected ,with both peregrinus (as a locative)
and regnum (as an objective genitive).

· ex megum] ‘from the position (status) of an alien' t cf. Sophocles,
Oed. Tyr. 454 τυφλὸς ἐκ δεδορκότος.

2 1 ulum] ‘ unexpectedly ἐ almost a summary of agnarum urbis and
non petentem. -

22 5 4. sul poma] ‘his own master,' i.e. by his father-’s death: see

cf. xxux. 28. 8 Hannibali, vix per se apsi tolerando ltaliae hosti ; xxv. 6.
10 pudendae clades. The gerundive of impersonal verbs like paenitet,
pudet is ‘scarcely to be regarded as passive, but rather as a reversion-
to the primary notion of a verbal adjective, in which the sense of
voice is indefinite: e. g. homo amandus = a man for the leving,

morum...appeuat1] sc. patrese ‘designated Fathers (i.e. headS,
chiefs) of secondary clans.’ It would seem that Tarquin‚ though
accepted as king by the people, was not acceptable to the Patres (who
were naturally jealous of a foreigner), and did not receive their con-
firmation (auctor-aas). To strengthen himself, then, and increase the
body-politic, he chose roo new senatorS, who became ipso facto Patres:
this new creation (factio haud dubia regis) doubled, according to
Cicero's account, the number of Patres (cf. Cic. Rep. 11. ἰο duplicavit
pois-tinum patrum numerum), and thus served to neutralise the opposi-
tion of the old nobility.

· That certain patrician gentes were called minores is a historical fact ε
Livy (like Cicero) attributes their creation to Tarquin. See n. on 36. ἰ
addere alias constituit. ·

9 ἕ ’1. oppidum 1121 Apiolas] ‘ the Latin township of Apiolae ’τ
