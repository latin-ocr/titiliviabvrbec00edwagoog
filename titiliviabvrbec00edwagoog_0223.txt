quentlz omitted in forms: cf. 32. 13 ficerunt deliqueram& ib. censuit,

conseruit, conscivit.

24 tabulis cerave] ‘tablets or wax,’ i-e. bare boards inscribed, or waxed
boards scratched with a style—the two usual forms of writing: cs.
GaiuS‚ 11. 104 haec ita, ut in his tabulis cerisque scripta sunt, ita de, ita
lqgv, ita testor. If these words belong to the original formula (which
some editors doubt), this is an early evidence of writing at Rome.

Law.

not uncommon in old formulas. The text is uncertain here: illo die
juppiter is the reading of some editions (adopted by Seeley), tum illico
Diespiter is suggested by Weissenborn.
