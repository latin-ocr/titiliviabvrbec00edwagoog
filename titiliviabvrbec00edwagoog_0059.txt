JNTR OD U‘CTJON liii

by the ¹servants of L. Tarquinius, This frequency of violence is
differently explained: we may see in it a repetition of patrician
efforts to remove a king of anti-patrician tendencies¹ 3 or we
may suppose that the Latin kings, and after them the Roman
kings, were looked upon as personating a god and put to death
in that capacity ². Whatever be the explanation, the fact remains
that no Roman king really appointed his successor: an inter-
regnum was necessary to that end.

The interregnum which ensued upon the death of Romulus
(c. 17) is doubtless intended by Livy to be typical. There
was a certamen regni ac cupido in the minds of the patres,
and a struggle between Roman and Sabine factions: and
ultimately there was an understanding between the electing
and the confirming bodies. To be complete, then, the election
of a Roman king required the civil and the ritual sanction,
imperium and auspicia: the first was consen-ed by a lex
curiata, the second was implied in the patrum auctorum-⁹». So
Numa, TulluS, and Ancus were regularly elected: but not so
the three last kings. It is obvious that the patres, would not,

⁸ Though the patrum auctoritas was necessary to complete the
election of a Roman king, it is not to be regarded as a mere confirma·
tion of the imperium, but rather as the ritual sanction, by which the
auspicia were entrusted to the king, and afterwards to the consuls. In
republican times imperium and auspicia are so closely associated as to
be almost inseparable; but they are distinguishable in the regal period.
It is not clear how the high-priesthood of the king (for the true king
was also chief priest) was recognized at the beginning of a new reign:
possibly it took effect from the patrum auctoritas, after a special
ceremony of inauguratio such as is mentioned by Livy in the case of
Numa (c. 18. 9). The title rex itself is thought by some authorities to
have denoted the king in his priestly capacity, ‘ the regulator ’ of
ritual and calendar, and to have been conferred before the imperium.
That there was a distinction between the ‘ spiritual ’ and the ‘temporal'
powers of the king is clear from the fact that when the imperium and

the auspicia passed to the consuls, the spiritualities were committed to
a rex sacrorum.
