§-1.⁴'L1vv’AN-D THE AususTAN AGE.

Censetur Apona Livio suo tellus. · Martial 1. 61. 3.

THE outline of Livy's life is simple but significant. He was
born at Patavium (Padua) in 59 or 58 B.C.‚ and died there in ΑΔ).
17 ; but he spent most of his mature lise in Rome, residing there
probably throughout the reign of AugustuS‚ so that in point of date
his activity may be said to coincide exactly with the Augustan
age. of himself he says scarcely anything1, and ancient authors
say little about him² 3 but mediae'val writerS‚ more su0, invent a
record sufficiently remarkable to save him from obscurity. Of
Patavium, which ‘ as in private duty bound ' he mentions at the
very beginning of the first book, we know that it was an ancient ,
city, famous always for its uncompromising love of liberty and
integrity, and¹ important in⁸ Livy's day for its commeree, its
waterS, and its oracle. The citizens were strong supporters of
Pompey in his struggle with Caesar, the events of which must
have impressed themselves upon the boyhood of Livy ; indeed,
he remained ‘ Pompeian '- all his‘ life, and it is possible that the
Patavinitas with which some of his critics found fault may be
partly connected with this unflinching adherence to republican
traditions. ,

As a natural result of rhetorical studieS, he composed several
popular dialogues-half-historical, half-philosophical in character
—and an epistle on rhetorical training, addressed to his son.

¹ Three passages (1. 19. 3, lv. 20. 7, and xxvru. η. 12) contain
all that he tells us' in this-connection.
· ² Suetonius says of Claudius (chapter 41) that in his youth he
essayed.to write. history, on the advice of Livy.
