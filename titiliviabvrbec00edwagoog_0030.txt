origin of Capua was accepted by Greek authoritieS, the affinity
between prehistoric Campanians and Latins suggested a Trojan
foundation of Rome ¹. The connection of the temple above·
mentioned with the matter may be due to the official sacrifice
performed annually by Roman magistrates at Lavinium: and
there is no sure indication that even the Laurentiue and Alban
communities had a common origin in this religious centre.

It is not possible to say how legenda of Greek manufactum,
such as those which attributed the foundation of Lanuvium to
DiomedeS‚ of Ardea to Danae, of Rome to AeneaS, came to be
adopted among the nativeS. Perhaps the Sibylline bookS,
which were brought to Rome from Cumae at the time of the
Tarquins‚ may have helped to win acceptance for these foreign
fabrics²; at any rate, the necessary opposition between Argives
and Trojans,‚and so the acceptance of a Trojan tradition, supplies
one explanation of the mysterious sacrifice of the Argei, which
is an element in the ancient ritual of Rome.

Once the legend of Aeneas had been fully accepted by the
Romans, it became necessary to reconcile it with native tradi·
tionS. Timaeus os Syracuse (fl. 27 5 B.C.) may be said to
represent this stage of the development: he, and the fragments
of other authors which have to do with this matter, makes
Lavinium the original settlement of Aenea5‚ and gives him only
indirect relationship with Rome. But herein no account was taken
of Alban legends—-and there were leading Roman gentes which
boasted Alban origin: and so, from Fabius Pictor onwards—i.e.

from the time of the F irst Punic War—the Roman annalists ·

traced the foundation of Rome from Aeneas through Lavinium
and Alba: and this ultimately became the approved tradition
thereof³. The Latin· traditions supplied material for further
elaboration: the rivalries of Lavinium and Ardea became those
of AeneaS‚ the founder of Lavinium, and Turnus, the King of
