14 tmpus] ‘ unnatural‚' offending against the pietas of father to son.
15 fl 0. forsita-n] Cf. Praefl 12.

ardum enquid] ‘an element of zeal': i-e.. in addition to the
obligation to defend a suppliant, some nation might feel a positive
desire to fight against a bitter tyrant (superbissimum regem).

17 ᾗ 10. ai nihil morarentur] ‘if they did not care at all’: this is
part of the reflection of the Gabines. nihil morari in this sense is
mainly a poetical usage, but cf. in. 54. 4 nihil ego quidem moror,
quominus decemviratu abeam. The phrase is found in a literal and
transitive sense (=not to detain at all), e.g. in the words with which
a consul dismissed the Senate (nihil amplius vos moramur) or an accuser
withdrew his charge (cf. lv, 42. 8 C. Sempronium nihil moror) ε it is
possible that the literal meaning is intended in the present case.

32 ἕ 2. praedatum] The supine—the acc. osa verbal noun—expresses
the object aimed at, with verbs os motion or kindred sense ε it is thus
not inappropriately coupled with such a phrase as in expeditiones] ‘ on
expeditioris ⁹—for training or reconnaissanoe ε cf. XXXIV. 62. 5 simul ad
purganda crimina et questum de se Romam eos ituros comperit.

P. 69. 2 vm...fldes] ‘their false confidence’ in him.

3 δ 8. inscia] The adjective is in sense a participle here (‘ not
knowing ’) and takes a dependent clause: cf. Caesar, B. G. v11. 77
inscii quid in Aeduis gernetun Horace, Odes 111. 5. 37 unde vitam
sumeret inscius. See n. on 48. 7 amens.
