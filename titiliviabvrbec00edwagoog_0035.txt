the sideS, and carried high enough to form battlements. 1f the
foundation of the city conformed, as it was supposed to have
done, to ancient ritual‚ there should be three gates, One gate
in the Palatine wall is mentioned by Livy in Book I, the vetus
porta Palati, near the temple of Jupiter Stator: the other two
seem to have been on the west and on the south, the latter
perhaps at the foot of the scalae Caci. ’

To this, the earliest settlement, tradition naturally assigns all
that belonged to the mythical founder-king—the Lupercal, cave
of the she-wolf foster-mother ; the hut of Faustulus (tugun‘um :
Livy's stabula), where the Twins were brought up and Romulus
afterwards dwelt (hence called casa Romuli); the place of his
augury. The first pomerium must have run round the Palatine ¹,
perhaps within· the wall ε yet Tacitus, in a careful description of
its supposed circuit, includes ancient land—marks (such as the
forum boarium, the ara maxima of Hercules, the altar of
Consus) which imply a wider ring outside the hill, and therefore
presumably belong to a stage just after the first.

In the history of Roman religion it is possible to discern
various stages of development: and it is not unreasonable to
connect with these, to some extent, similar stages in the
political growth of the several communities settled by the
Tiber. In the beginning the Italian tribes believed that spirits
(numina) dwelt in everything--sky and thunder‚ fire and water,
stoneS, trees and animals: examples may be seen in the stone
of TerminuS, the oak of Feretrius, the fig-trec, the wolf. This
‘animismss as it is called, did not at first endue the spirits of its
adoration with definite epithetS, much less with definite person-
ality. But the propitiation of the numina was all-important to
the health‚ wealth and happiness of those primitive rovers of the
wood and the hill; and the type of such worship as they
rendered is to be seen in the Lupercalia and the Consualia, in
which at first no definite deity is clearly discernible. But

antiquissimum autem pomerium quod a Romulo institutum est Palatini
montis radicibus terminabatur.
