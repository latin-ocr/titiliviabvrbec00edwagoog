A critical examination of the stories relating to him, though
it may discredit our belief in the personality of any such king,
yet leaves us convinced that he represents a definite stage in the
development of the kingship. He has been identified with that
mythical Etruscan Mastarna who freed from bondage his ¹
friend Caelius Vibenna (as is seen in the famous wall-painting
at Volci), and helped him to establish a company of Etruscans
on the Caelian hill, with the consent of Tarquinius Priscus or os
some other king¹; and then (according to the annalists whom
the Emperor Claudius, a student of Etruscan antiquitieS,
followed in a well-known speech) took the name os Servius
Tullius. This looks suspiciously like a fusion of Etruscan and
Latin traditions: and the tale that Servius Tullius was the off-
spring of a divine father—the Lar or the fire-spirit—and of a
slave-mother is entirely in accordance with the old tradition of the
Latin kings ². The fire that played about his head in infancy is
a fitting testimony to so miraculous an origin. Latin, t00, is
the tale that he succeeded to the kingship by marriage with the
daughter os the ruling Tarquin ε so N uma, according to tradition,
married the daughter of Titus Tatius, and Tarquin the Proud
the daughter of ServiuS. And from a Latin source is probably
to be traced the origin of his name and the reason of his place
in the kingly series,

Now Roman tradition had a practical aim-to demonstrate
that from earliest ages the imperial city became the centre of
the Latin league‚ and assumed the primacy of Latium ³. Alba
Longa had been destroyed before the era of Servius TulliuS, but
the festival in honour os Iuppiter Latiaris on the Alban mount
was still the central rite of the Latin League. Meanwhile another
city, Aricia, with its cult of Diana, in which some seven other cities
joined, had been rising to prominence; and before long the
goddess took her place beside the god in the worship os the
