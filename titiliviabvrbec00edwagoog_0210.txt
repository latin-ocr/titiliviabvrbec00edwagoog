in its lintei and two side-posts‚ the door represents a triple Janus. Cf.
A. B. Cook, op. cit. p. 3693 F razer, op. cit. p. 289.
The arch of Ianus geminus (bifrons), with the double-headed figure ἢ
above, was situated to the N.E. of the Forum. ι
Arg-uotum] the region N.E. of the Forum, which afterwards became
the Booksellers' Row of Rome. The word, fancifully connected by
Virgil (Aen. vul. 346) with the death of an Argive in Evander's day, is
perhaps derived from arg-illa, ‘white clay‚’ the termination being
collective, like olivetum, buxetum.
indicemJ‘ an ensign.’ apertus.. clausus] Notice the emphatic
position.

same year.

Augustus had the door closed again in 25 13.c. and in 4 B.c., so that this
statement os Livy gives us one clue to the date of this book.

Aug-usto] Octavian received this title in 27 Β. c.-another clue.

by side, and the relation between them is indicated in Cic. Phil. 11.

29 commento miraculi] ‘ fictitious miracle.'

30 Egeria] i.e. ‘the Deliverer‚' a nymph, or Camena, connected with
sources and bubbling streams (cf. Curtius vu. 5 aqua, quae egeritur ex
terra), who can aid prophets or teachers in delivering their burden:
cf. n. on Camenis, 21. 3. Egeria was also a trec-spirit, and her name
may be etymologically connected with the oak: thus she may be a
duplicate of Diana. We see from Virgil, Aen. vu. 763, that she was
associated at Aricia with Virbius and Diana. The mystical union of
Numa (as an impersonation of the oak god, in virtue of his kingship)
and Egeria is in this case to be interpreted as a duplicate of the union

between the King and Queen of the Wood. Cf. Frazer, op. cit. pp. 196, 1
217. ,
