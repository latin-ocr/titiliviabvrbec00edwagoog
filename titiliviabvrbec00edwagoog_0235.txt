mart ’). Fowler, R. E, p. 253. We may compare the fairs formerly
held in the Isle of Ely on St Awdry’s day (17 Oct.), and in Paris on
and after the feast of St Denys (9 Oct.).

10 v ἓ 8. 11ιιο...ι·οῡοιιῦοε] It is not quite clear what substantive is to be
supplied with suos. (1) Dionysius (111. 32) has ὅτι τοὺς Σαβίνων
φυγάδας ( ⁴ exiles ') ὑπεδέχοντο κατασκευάσαντες ἄσυλον ἱερὸν, which suits
the sense here. (α) Perhaps it should be ‘slaves‚’ as Madvig thinks,
believing that the word servos-has dropped out from similarity to suos.
It is possible that servos and not suos is the right reading. lucum is
probably to be referred (cf. Dion. H„ l.c.) to ‚a refuge like that of
Romulus (see 8. 5—6 above): runaway slaves were a frequent cause
of quarrels between primitive nations.

12 ferebantur] ‘ were alleged, brought forward.’

haud...memoren] ‘ not disposed ,to forget.’ locatam...aucta.m]
sc. esse.

15 et ipsi] ‘ in their turn‚' ‘like their opponents': see n. on Praef. 3.

ἓ ’1. Etruria erat vicina] Attention was drawn to this in 23. 8
above.

16 reddum bellorum] ‘ remaining from the wars.' Gen. of remoter
object, i.e. the verbal construction would be such as Livy has in XL. 7. 5
i'rarm si qua ex certamine residet.

18 traxere] i.e. ad se, .‘ attracted.' traho is a favourite word with Livy z ·
cf. 7. 13 24· 1.

19 publico] ‘formal,’ ‘ official': cf. 26. 14.

20 mnus mltum] Probably because most of the lesser states concerned
had more to gain than to lose by friendship with Rome: the VeientineS,
as Etruscam, were less likely to be true.

21 pacta...ndes] ‘the bond of the truce arranged with Romulus '—after
the struggle mentioned in c. 27.

α 3 ἕ 8. continuati-anaim] For this usage of occupo cf. 14. 4.

25 δ 0. Malitiosam] Dionysius (111. 33) calls it ὕλη κακοῦργος. Both
epithets mean ‘ crafty,’ ‘ cunning,' so Silva M. may be translated ‘ Wily
Wood.' Did the battle name the wood, or the wood the battle?
We do not know. If the former, then perhaps a successful stratagem
(as in c. 14) was executed by the Romans: if the latter, we must trace
the title back to a primitive belief in the deceitful or destructive powers
of wood-spirits. It is worth noticing in this connection that Dionysius
(v. 16) says that the Romans attributed to Faunus the same power of
causing sudden panic which the Greeks ascribed to Pan.

quidem...oeterum] ‘to some extent ’... ‘for the test ' or ‘ mainly.'
