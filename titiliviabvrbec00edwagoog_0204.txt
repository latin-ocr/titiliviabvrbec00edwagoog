The meaning of patres auctores fiunt has been much disputed. The
evidence shows that these patres cannot be identified (1) with the
(Republican) Senate, because vin ‘the struggle concernin'g the 'Licinian
Rogations the Senate were overcome, but patricii se auctores futuros
negabant (Vl. 42. 10): nor (α) with the Comitia Curiata, which (at least in
Republican times) was not exclusively Patrician‚ ‘and itself, needed ,the
patrum auctoritas for its resolutioris (vl. 41.- ιο).., Moreover‚ Servius
Tullius (cf. Cic. de Rep. 11. αι) obtained the lesser, but not ther-greater
sanction—non commisit se patribus sed· T arquinio sepulto populum de·
se ipse consuluit, iussusque regnare: legem de imperto suo curiatam tulit.

In another passage ‘of Cicerolfflro Domo, 14. 38) a'51ist of peculial-ly
Patrician offices and privileges is given: ita populus ,Romanus brevi
tempore neque regem sacrorum, neque flamines, neque Salios habehit, nec
ex parte dimidia reliquos sacerdotes, ,neque auctores centuriatorum et
curiatorum comitiorum .- auspiciaque populi> Romani, si magistratus
patricii creati non sint, intereant necesse est, cum ‘interrex nullus sit,

quod et ipsum patricium esse et a patnciis , prodi necesse est. Ther'e ,

would seem, then, to have been a recognised body of patres or' patricii
who had originally the power of conducting and confirming the mo'st
important religious and state procedure. · · ’

The simplest explanation of the problem is undoubtedly that of
Professor Ridgeway, who (in the paper referred to in the note on 15. 6
creditae above), from the evidence afforded by material remainS, tradition,
priesthoods, marriage riteS, disposal of the dead', and ⁴'language‚⁴ argues,
that the Patricians are Sabines (who had conquered Rome), the Plebeians
Ligurians.
