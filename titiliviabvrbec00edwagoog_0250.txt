second expression is merely a more definite testatement of the same

fact. For the pair of ablativae see note on η. ιο.
31 et.. ,οη 1. e. there was fighting round about the walls and in the open.

comminus in the second clause implies that a good deal of the fighting
in the other case was carried on eminus, at long range,

p. 45. ἰ 5 6. omnibus...con1m] ‘with a supreme effort of his
whole force)

6 ad. numine] i.e. ad aram (sacellum) Murciae, in the valley afterwards
occupied by the'Circus MaximuS, between the Palatine and the Aventine.
The name Murcia may belong to the valley itself (i.e. ‘swampy,' cf.
marceo) 3 or to an old name os the Aventine ; or to an ancient goddess of
‘ Ease’ (cf. mulcere, Mulciber, and mur-cidus ‘ indolent ²), perhaps brought
thither by the Latin immigrants on this occasion, and then applied as an
epithet to Venus (cf. Libentina and Volupia). The variant spellings
Martia, Myrtea led some ‚antiquariaus (eg. Varm, L. L. v. ἓ 154) to
connect the word with the myrtle. In any case, this beoeme the most
important shrine of Venus in Rome. Cf. Preller, R. M„ 1. pp. 438—9.

ἓ ο. Iamoulum] i.e. the abode of JanuS‚ who was supposed to have
reigned there in the prehistoric age. The oak woods on this hill may
supply the explanation sor the connection os the god with it.

8 muro] i.e. the spot selected as an outwork was enclosed. But it is
by no means probable that the Janiculum was sortified thus early:
perhaps Livy is repeating a mistake contained in his authorities

‚ob commoditatem itineris] ‘ for convenience of transit.’

9 ponto sublicio] ‘the bridge of piles ’ (sublicae). It was originally
made of wood throughout (perhaps lest the use of iron might offend the
river-god), and had often to be repaired in consequence.

in 'ribei-lm] ‘ over the Tiber.’ The abl. with in is more usual in this.
phrase, and is read here by Madvig: but the acc. may be defended on
the ground of the motion implied in the actual construction.
ιο ἓ ’1. Quiritium quoque fossa] quoque here refers not to the word
immediately preceding, but to Quiritium fissa, taken together as a
single notion. Cf. 36. 1 muro quoquc lapideo...parabat. The position
of the Quiritium fissa is not known. Such dykes might well precede
more definite fortification of the city. Festus (p. 254) mentions Quiritium
fhssae dug in the reign of Ancus Marcius round Ostia 3 another authority
(de Vir. Ill. vm. 1. 3) applies the same term to the sewers dug by the
under of Tarquinius Superbus. ,

11 a plamonbus...locis] ‘on the side, of localities more level in· ap-

proach’: cf. 12. 2 ab Sabinis, 17. aab s'ua parte, 37. 5 ab corm‘bus.
