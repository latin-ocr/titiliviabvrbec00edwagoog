opposition. . .

2 7 g 7. iam tum] i.e. before this, at the time of the murder (see ἕ ι).

29 Sumam l’omaetim] in the country of the Volsci, according to 53. 2
below· Its position is not known ε it is thought by some authorities to
have been at the N. end of the Pomptine marsh.

multtum] Such retirement into exile (i.e. into the territory of

a state having certain relations with Rome), sor the purpose of avoiding
possible condemnation and punishment, came to be regarded as a right
(ius exsulandi) in the republican period. As Cicero says (pro Caecina
34) exsilium enim ηοη supplicium est, sed perfugium portusque supplicii .·
...conflagiunt quasi ad aram, ίη exsilium. So in c. 54. 9 some of
Tarquin's prospective victims seek safety in exile. The infliction of
exile (with loss of civitas and sometimes of bona) as a penalty belongs to
the latter days of the Republic.

assigned to Lucius, the younger to Arruns: but Livy’s account (see
46. 9) is not clear on this point.

iuvenibus reg-11³] They may have been sons or grandsons of Tarquint
if the former (as Livy in 46. 4, 48. 2 is inclined to consider them), they
married their nieces on this occasion, an alliance held in historic times
to be illegal-

idea of a jealous Fate resembles the Nemesis which occasionally
appears in the narrative of Herodotus.

qul iu] The relative clause gives the circumstances (⁸ inasmuch as ’)‚
from the writer's point of view. Most textS, however, read quin
here. quin regularly follows verbs of prohibition and prevention, when
they are in the negative, and is here attached (with the meaning of ut
non) to a phrase of the same character: so in v. 45. 7 vix temperavere
animis, quin extemplo impetum facerent3 and in Horace, Sat. 11. 3. 42
nil verbi, pereas quin fortiter, addam.

4 invidia reg-m] ‘ill-feeling against his kingship.' regni is objective
genitive: invidia, is quin be read, is either nominative, or ablative of
cause·

infida...1nfuta] ⁴ general insincerity and animosity ἐ or perhaps
infestus has its other meaning here (cf. c. 47. 1) and should be rendered
by ‘ insecurity.’
