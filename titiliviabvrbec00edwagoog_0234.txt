announced in 28. 7. The king, as chief magistrate, chose his own
councillors: so under the Republic the lectio senatus belonged to the
consuls first, then to the censors. Romulus (see 8. 7) created 100
senators: Tullus now added an Alban contingent: Tarquinius Priscus
(see 35. 6) raised roo heads of minores gentes to the honour. By this
reckoning Livy obtains a total os 300, which was the regular comple·
ment until Sulla’s time.

30 milon] Iulios has been suggested‚· in order to make Livy agree
with Dionysius (111. Ι39). sse uncertainty here, in the case of a most
important gens, suggests that all these heroic origins must be regarded
with suspicion.

31 ordini] Cf.· ordinum below. Livy, mindsul of the three ordines
(‘ estates ⁹) οἱ his own day—senatorial, equestrian, plebeian—makoe
Tullus distribute the Alban immigrants according to a similar division.

tammum] ‘a close‚' ‘enclosure’z cf. n. on 18. 9. surim] in
apposition to templum (cf. ιο. 6 templum...sedem) 3 ‘ as a court-house.’
It was situated N. os the Forum and Comitium. The building‚ having
been restored by Sulla, was burnt with the body of Clodius (52 B.C.),
restored again by Sulla’s son, and then demolished by Julius Caesar,
who set on the same site a temple to Felicitas.

32 Hostilia] There were besides the Curia Iulia (built by Julius Caesar
and Augustus) and the Curia Pompeia (where Caesar was assassinated),
in which also the Senate met.

patrum] i.e. the last generation before Livy: not used for maiorum.
The name Hostilia lasted apparently till the burning of 52 B.c.

P. 40· 3 ἓ 8. turmas] ‘troops.’ Properly turma=3o men, ἡ of an
ala: so the Alban contribution was just one ala, 300 men. Romulus
(13. 8) had enrolled 3 centuriae, so (according to Livy) this Alban con·
tingent doubled the cavalry. For the separate organisation of turmae,
which this passage seems to support, see note on 13. 8.

eodem supplemento] ‘ with a reinforcement (draft) from the same
source. ’ scripsit] = conscripsit.

5 ἓ 4. hac fiducia virium] ‘ then, relying on his forces': hac: ‘thus
given)

8 τοῦ repetitae] Cf. 22. 4—7, 32. 6—14.

9 ἓ ο. ad Paron-lae fanum] Feronia was essentially an Italian
(rather than a Roman)- goddeSS‚ associated from early times with the
working classes-plebeiam, freedmen‚ slaves. Her chief shrine was
at Trebula Mutusca (in the S. of the Sabine territory), and here during
her festival was held a great fair (so mercatu frequenti ‘ at a crowded
