the Latin plain to the Alban mountain and the long line of hills
—the last spurs ·of the Apennines—enclosing the plain to the
north, can fail to realize that Rome was omjg‘inally an outpost qf
the Latins, her kinsmen and confederateS, against the powerful
and uncanny Etruscan race who dwelt in the undulating hill
country to the north ¹.² The essence of a good defence is counter-
attack and security of communications: and both are truly
exemplified in the possession of the Silva Mesia and the occupa-
tion of Ostia.

This colony is unanimously assigned by tradition to Ancus
Marcius: but it is not clear for what reason. A modern view
makes another Marcius the founder—C. Marcius RutiluS‚ dictator
in 356 B.C., who defeated the Etruscans at the spot²t but the
foundation of a colony there in Republican days is not mentioned,
and, moreover, probability would suggest that before Veii was
conquered the mouth of the Tiber was secured by the Romans³.
The occupatiori of Ostia and of the salt-pits indicates a strategical
and a commercial shrewdness not unworthy of a king who is
the type of all-round competence, in peace and war, and withal
perhaps (like some Greek tyrant of the same era) a seeker after
popularity, as Virgil thinks in the quotation given at the head of
this section4.

The traditional record follows the lines of topographical
probability in filling in the main differences between the ‘city of
Tatius' and that which was to be enclosed within the Servian
wall. We have arrived in fact at the period sometimes known
as ‘the city of the Four Regions'-—Suburana⁵, Esquilina, Collina,

⁸ Cf. De SanctiS, 1. pp. 370-1.

⁴ Servius, in his commentary on these lines, preserves a statement of
Pompeius Sabinus to the effect that Ancus chased at the rule of TulluS,
itaque statuerat favore populari Tullum regem cum tota familia occiakre.

⁶ The Suburana included the Sucusa, Ceroliensis and Caelius itself ε
it must not be confused with the Subura, which in historical times
denotes the valley between the Oppian and Cispian mounts. Cf.
Platner‚ p. 40.
