that Livy's totals, reckoned as asses librales, supply a clue to the refer-med
ratings.

Mommsen considers that land was the basis of the Servian assaesment
—the hide for the first clasS, and proportional quantities sor the others.
But res mancipi (real property) on which the assessment was made,
included not only land in fec simple, but oxen, at any rate those broken
to the yoke. So Cicero (de Rq. 11. 9. 16) says, in regard to the age of
Romulus, tum erat res in pecore et Iocorum possessionibus, ex quo
pecuniosi et locupletes vocabantur. It is then quite possible that the
Servian rating of all res mancipi was expressed first in terms of oxen:
rating by cattle, not land, was actually practised in Sicily (cf.
Ridgeway, Ongin of Currcncy and Wezjght Standards, p. 393). The
reckoning by aes signatum, if we ascribe the introduction thereos to
Servius, would provide a subsidiary means of valuation, suitable to
smaller properties and to the cases of incmsi.

In the centuries between the reign os Servius Tullius and the reform
of the comitia centuriata, the value of real property in and near
Rome must surely have increased τ and it is reasonable to suppose that
the introduction of changes in currency necessitated revisions of the
census-ratings. For instance, the year 338 B.c., in which according to
some authorities asses were first coined at Rome, was the beginning of
the Roman supremacy, commercial as well as political‚ over the Latius.
The value of Roman res mancipi, we may well believe, was greatly
enhanced at this time: and the census-ratings may have risen then to a
standard which, though not equal to that adopted after the great Punic
WarS, was altogether different from that of the Servian era.

whole phrase is dependent on censum, ‘rating.'

22 centuriae] i.e. ‘hundreds’ or units of organization, varying necessarily
according to the number of citizens contained in each classis: there
would obviously be more poor citizens than rich, and conversely fewer
members of a centuria in the higher classes of the Servian constitution
than in the lower. Each centuria or unit would be required to furnish
for the military levy (dilectus) a certain quota, a centuria for service.

23 seniorum ae iuniorum] The seniores were men between 45 and 60
years of age ε the iuniores between 17 and 45 (inclusive).

men called (cf. calare) to the colours. The five classes thus consisted· of
