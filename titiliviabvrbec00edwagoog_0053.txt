general significance of the innovations associated by Livy with
his reign—the census, the tributum, the new army of classes
and centurieS, the lustrum, the four local tribes, the inclusion of
the Quirinal and Viminal hills, the extension of the pomerium,
the fortification of the city, the League of Latins and the Aventine
temple of Diana—is that the city-state of Rome was laying upon
a broader basis the foundations of sovereignty. The period of
Servius Tullius at Rome was then somewhat similar to that of
Peisistratus—roughly contemporary—at Athens. The curia, in
all its senses—military, territorial, political, religious—-was
replaced by a wiser, because a wider, organisation. The needs
and the responsibilities of a nation were beginning to be realised.

We have found it convenient to regard Numa as representa-
tive of the older, native-bom religious beliefs (di Indzjgetes), and
of the sterner Sabine ritual and rule3 and we may associate
with the age of Servius Tullius the recognition of new cults
(di Novensiles), introduced to the Romans and accepted by
them in consequence of the increase of trade and other dealings
with their Sabine, Latin, Greek, and Etruscan neighbourS. It
is a period, then, of outside influence in religion ¹, justas the rise
of the plebeians represents the influence of other elements in
the state and constitution. The immigrants‚ or tradem, brought
their godS, or at any rate their cultS, with th'em: Greek merchants
may thus have introduced HeracleS, and him the Romans
received from them as Hercules, perhaps after he had been
localised and Latinised at Tibur²z anyhow, his Latinity was so
far accepted that his altar was admitted within the pomerium,
and set up in the sorum boarium, an altar of altars (ara
maxima) which tradition connected, as has been seen above
(ξ 4), with the foundation-days of Rome. The Graecus ritus
may have been introduced later into this cult of Hercules: it
was certainly the rule in a temple of Hercules founded by Sulla
near the Circus Flaminius, τῖε. outside the pomerium&
