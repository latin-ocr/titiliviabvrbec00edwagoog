XLVI §5] NOTES 195

vellent iuberentne] the regular formula for introducing a rogatio,
The two verbs (velitis iubeatisne) are as it were hyphened, and thus the
interrogative particle is attached to the second. Asyndeton is not un-
common in formulae: cf. 24. 7 prima postrema: 32. 13 fecerunt
deliquerunt.

14 5 a* impensius] ‘more vehemently’—-to be taken with criminandi.
The same word occurs in 40. 2.

qnia...a.gi] ‘because he had realised that the Act relating to land
for the populace was opposed to the feeling of the PatreS‚’—and knew
also that to the patrum voluntas (see 4ῐ. 6) Servius had originally
owed his succession.

1 7 crescendi] ‘of gaining power': cf. crescere below,¹ 47. 7.

18 et ipso] For the usual meaning see n. on Praef. 3. In the present
case it helps to give iuvenis ardentis animi a quasi-participial force (in
Greek we should have had καὶ αὐτὸς ὢν νεανίας), by way os balancing
the participial clause uxore...stimulante.

19 5 8. tunt] ‘produced.'

20 et Romana. tegla] i.e. no less than the house of Atreus or of
Oedipus. For regia see n. on 39. 3.

eoelerle tragici exemplum] ‘its type of tragic outrage‚’ i.e. ‘of
tragedy and crime.’

ut...feret] Here again (as in 42. 2) Livy speaks with an air of
fatalism which reminds us of Herodotus

²3 5 4. mlus neposne] See n. on 42. 1.

24 pluribus...auctor1bun] ablative absolute. ediderim] a subjunctive
of polite assertion‚ equivalent to the Greek aor. optative-hdr: cf. 55. 8
crediderim, Cic. Brut. 83 sic ego istis censuerim novam istam orationem
fiegz'endam. Roby, 5 644.

27 5 ὅ. et ipsae] See n. on Praef. 3.

28 no...1ungotontur] expresses the purpose, not the consequence, of
fortuna (which is best taken as an ablative, not as nominative to
inciderat): quo...possent adds a second purpose. fortuna populi Romani
has here something of a personal character, as elsewhere in Livy (e.g.
II. 40. 13 ibi fmuna populi Romani duos hostium exercitus...confecit;

XXXVIII. 46. 4 magna fortuna populi Romani, magnum et terribile nomen).
This is not surprising when it is remembered that Fortuna was included

in the Roman Pantheon. credo then gives a touch of scepticism on the

part of the author.
30 consutus...pomnt] ‘that the character of the community might

become settled. ’
