CHAPTER L.

13 ξ Ι.. in diem...1nd101t] The use of indicit with ut is not elsewhere
found, but the subordinate clause is really equivalent to concilium,
and the phrase concilium in ⁷diem certam indicere occurs in Caesar,
B. G. 1. 30: cf. Livy 111. 35. 1 comitia in tn‘num nundinum.

14 Ferentinae] The form of the word suggests an epithet rather than
the actual name of a goddess: it may be that we have here the equi-
valent of the Diana mentioned in c. 45 as the goddess associated with
the league of Romans and Latins. The lucus Ferentinae stood at the
source of the aqua Ferentina (so in 51. 9 ad caput aquae Ferentinae,
11. 38. 1 caput Ferentinum), on the north shore os the Alban Lake τ the
mention of grove and spring denotes a primitive cult.

eene] The ρζ. obl. indicates the terms of the indicium.
15 agere] ‘discuss’t cf. our use of ‘agenda’ in a notice of meeting.
16 frequentes] ‘in full muster ² ε so again in 52. 5.
<19 ἕ 2. occideret] The subj. after ante quam implies something more

’ than a mere statement of fact—some thought or intention of anticipating
the sunset on the part of Tarquin. The concilium could do no business
after sunset.

toto die] expresses the time within which (not during which) the
general discussion had gone on.

conctno] This word is regularly used by Livy to denote the
assemblies or meetings of confederate communities (popum—eg. Aequi,
SamniteS, AchacanS, Aetolians—attended by delegates or by any citizens
able to corne. It is thus appropriate here as applied to a meeting of the
Latinorum proceres, convened by the head of the league. The gradual
prohibition of such concilia was one feature of the Roman progress
towards supremacy in Italy and Greece. ·

19 5 8. Turnus] See n. on α. 1. ab Aricia]=Aricinus (51. 1).
Livy often uses the preposition ab with the name of a town to denote
the origin of a person ε cf. 11. 22. α a Cora atque Pometia liberos. Aricia
was S. of the Alban Lake, S. W. of Alba: it was the centre of the
most famous cult of Diana.

αι hand mirum esee] This is the beginning of the or. obl„ which
continues to observet (end of 56).

superbo] See n. on 34. 3 Egerio. Here (as in 4. 7) ei is to be
supplied.

22 dm...tmen] ‘in secret undertoneS, but still commonly enough.’
This use of quidem...tamen in antithesis corresponds to the Greek μὲν...
δέ, or to καίπερ...ὅμως (with participles).
