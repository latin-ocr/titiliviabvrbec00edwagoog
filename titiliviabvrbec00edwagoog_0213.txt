associated represent the association of the two separate communities
originally occupying these hills. Further evidence of this association
is seen in the two sets of Salii (see note below). Cf. Fowler, R. F.

19 ἓ 8. Vestae] ‘for (the service of) Vesta,’ dat. of indirect object.

For the significance of the Vestals see n. on 3. 11.

Alba oriundum] ‘ of Alban origin ' z cf. 17. 2.

genti...nau‹1 menum] ‘ not unconnected with the stoek of the
founder ’ (os Alba). For the dative see n. on 15. 6 nihil absonum fichi.

20 antistites] ‘ priestesses in chief,’ ‘ chief celebrants.’

21 ahisque caerimoniis] ‘and by ceremonies as well.’ The maiden
was transferred by a special ceremony (captio) from the potestas of her
father into that of the pontifex maximus: then she was taken to the
atriam Vestae: her hair was cut off and dedicated : then she put on the
white clothes of her office, and was sworn in.

ἰα ἓ 4. mos] i.e. ‘dancers.’ This was an ancient guild of priest-
warriors‚ belonging to a primitive cult. Such guilds existed in
many places in Italy; in Rome itself there were 12 Palatini, for the
worship of Mars GradivuS, and 12 Collini (cf. 27. 7 below), for that of
Quirinus· Probably their solemn dance in procession with the ancilia,
which took place in March, represented the protection of the corn-spirit
from hostile demons. Cf. Fowler, R. F. pp. 41—2.

23 Gradivo] is differently explained: (Ι) from gradior, ‘the strider ’;
(2) from gravi-divus, ‘the sorceful ’ 3 and (3) Festus, p. 97 quia gramine
sit ortus. The first explanation, by which Mars is the ‘ God of
Marching,' a good soldierly epithet, seems to be the right one.

timim pictae insigne] ‘ the distinction of the embroidered doublet.'
The Salii wore also the trabea and apex, and a sword, and carried in
the right hand a short stick‚ with which they struck the ancilia.

25 ancilia] ‘ sacred shields.' The word is derived from amb· and caede,
denoting that the shields had two curved indentations in the rim, which

made them like violins in shape. The tradition was that one shield fell ’

from heaven, and eleven more were made exactly like it, that it might
not be known and stolen.

The shape of the shield is identical with those of the Mycenaean age,
and is perhaps <like the scutum) to be traced to the Pelasgians or
Aborigines. The Umbro-Latius had a round shield. Ridgeway,
