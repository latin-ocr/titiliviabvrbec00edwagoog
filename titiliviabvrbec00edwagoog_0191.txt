xl ξ 5] NOTES 11 1

in lv. 32· 11 a Dictator exhorts his Master of the Horse to be memor
opimi doni, Romulique ac Iovis Feretrii.

27 Una] ‘ on two ocoesiona’ spolia opima is like castra, a plural with ·
a special meaning: so bina not duo.

inter] ‘in the course os’: cs. ²9· 1 inter haec iam praemissi Albam

erant equites, 55. 3 inter principia condendi huius operit.

29 eiua fortuna. deuotis] ‘the happiness of that distinction.’ fortuna
·--τὸ εὔδαιμον, implying at once that to win the spolia opima was a rare
piece os luck, and also that it was vouchsafed from heaven (cs. dir vuum).

CHAPTER XI.

31 5 Ι.. per emonem ac solitudinem] is a-lgggfflflffl, ‘took ad·
vantage of the absence os defenders.’
hoctfflter] ⁸ as an act of war.’ ad hou] ‘to meet them. ’
po 16· 1 10810] ⁴ levyss
α oppressit] ⁸ caught.’
5 2. impetu et niumm] ⁶ charge and cheer.’

3 ovantem] See 26. ιο n.

4 noi-stlta] The name belongs originally to a Sabine deity, the mate
of Quirinus: then, when Quirinus and Romulus were identified, Hersilia
took human form as chief of the Sabine women, and was associated
with Romulus. She was supposed to have taken the lead (which as
a Sabine patron-saint of marriage she would naturally do) in making
peace after the battle mentioned by Livy in c. 12.

precibus faunu] ⁴ importuned by the prayers ’—just as Queen
Esther was importuned by the prayers of Mordecai (Esther, iv.).
8 5 8. merueram] ‘ were already depressed.’
9 5 4. utroque] i.e. to Antemnae and Crustumerium.
volumno] Here Livy assumes that the conquests of Rome were
colonized in the fashion of a later time, and thus carries the system
back to Romulus.

ιο in Grumum.. ‚darentj‘ gave in their names for (offered to go
to) the Crustumine territory? nomina dare is properly a military
phrase, ‘to enlist’ ε and this was practically enlistment for colonial
service.

1 1 migratum] Romulus did not object to this, as he wanted a settled
population.

¹3 5 ὁ. novimum] ‘last of all’· for the predicative use of the
adjective cs. Praes. ιι tam serae.. ‚immigraverina
