anything to do with ‘three'z and it is unnecessary to treat the
matter here. Suffice it to say that the Titienses usually stand
first, which seems to support the idea of a Sabine conquest3
that the association of Titienses and Ramnenses may express
⁰ just such a fusion of Sabine and Latin elements as we have
been considering; that Luceres may represent a third clement
(eg. the settlers on the Esquiline who had shared in the
Septimontium) of the same period, or a later addition; that
throughout the names are closely connected with the military
establishment of the pre-Servian state, each tribe contributing
one hundred cavalry, and possibly 1000 infantry. It seems
conceivable therefore that we are concemed with what might
almost be called regimental names; and this will serve to
explain in some degree the reluctance to interfere with them at
the bidding of a non-Sabine, non-patrician king at a later date,
and their ultimate inclusion, as a distinct unit, a corps d'e'lite, in
the Servian establishment.

The life of such a community as is implied by a king, senate,
cun‘ae, and centuriae, represents a civilisation which has pro-
gressed beyond the hill-top and the pastum-land to ordered
ways of town and farm, and likewise beyond the elemental
‘animism ² of earliest worship. We are arrived, in fact, at the

‘N uma' period in Roman religion. For as Titus Tatius
represents the military aspect of the Sabine conquest, so Numa
Pompilius may stand for the religiouS, or rather the ritual,
aspect. It is quite conceivable that there was no attempt,
because there was no opportunity, to frame a ritual system for
the state, as distinct from family and curia, until the Sabines
became partnerS, and dominant partnerS, therein. The sacra
must have been a strong unifying influence--more than that,
the very bond of union—in each curia. But when the patres,
the heads of familieS, whether exclusively Sabine or including
other elements as well, advanced a step in political development
by joining to elect a common head, and to supply his council and
his army, the state which they formed needed a ritual sanction.
Imperi⁸um was born: it needed the baptism of sacra and
auspicia. Act 1 (Romulus and Tatius) was naturally followed
