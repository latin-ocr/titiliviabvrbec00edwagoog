Vesta and the PenateS, was the religious metropoliS, but Alba
was the federal centre, and on the Alban mount the fhn'ae
Latinae were celebrated from the first. The religious associa-
tion between the communities, perhaps about fifty in number, led
naturally to commercial and political understandings: and, with
the destruction of Alba, Rome became the guardian of these
prisci Latini, and so remained, but not without challenge or
interruption, till the dissolution of the Latin League in 338 B.C.
And Rome was not guardian only, but ruler by right of conquest

early times the Roman city-state began to be ambitious for the

monarch which is represented in the chronicles of the Tarquins
is not the rex of Latin or Italian tradition, with an imperium
which implied responsibility, but a ‘tyrant' after the pattern
familiar in Greek history. It is not improbable that such
‘tyrants’ may have occupied the throne at Rome in the course
of the political transition from monarchy to republic: but
whether they were few or many it is not possible to determine.

Among modern critics the opinion is widely held that Tar-
