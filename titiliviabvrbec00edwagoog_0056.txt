other citizenS, if their property qualification was such as to place
them among the assidui. But though a general uniformity was
aimed at in the new exercitus, there is still evidence that the
older organisation was not—indeed, could not be—entirely
ignored. In the British standing army after the Restoration of
1660, Royalist and Cromwellian elements formed the nucleus of
separate regiments: and likewise, of the 18 centuries of equites
in the army of ServiuS, six certainly represented the old
Patrician cavalry of birth, and twelve were recruited on the new
establishment of wealth. Again, the armament of the first classis
of infantry—the classis to which, in an especial sense, the very
title was applied—included the clipeus, or round shield‚ while
that of the second and third classes (according to Livy) included
the scutum, or half-cylindrical shield: and this difference in the
shape of shields implies a difference of military tradition, and
even of race ¹. The general fighting formation of the Servian
army seems to have been a phalanx of Dorian type, but this is
surely an anachronism in an army of the sixth century Rc·
Some such formation, however, may have been adopted by the
Roman republic for its infantry, when frequent wars brought
closer acquaintance with the military systems of the Samnites
and the city-states of Magna Graecia: and tradition records
that the Romans copied the famous cavalry system of the
Tarentines. Itis not known how the equites of the regal period
manoeuvred. Τὴε presence of war-chariots in the field is, at
any rate, implied by such instances as the execution of Mettius
Fufetius the Alban dictator2.

The religious ceremony which completed the census and the
inspection-parade of the new army was the Suovetaurilia, per-
formed outside the pomerium at the altar of Mars, in the plain
which bore his name. This sacrifice was not in itself an inno-
vation: from remote antiquity the farmer had thus performed a
service of expiation and purification, driving the three animals

thought to imply that the first classis was composed of SabineS.
