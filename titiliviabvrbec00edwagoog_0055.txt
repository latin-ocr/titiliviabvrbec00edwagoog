(tn‘butum), but that they had 'nothing to do with the total or
classifieation of the centuries in the ‘new model’ army of
Servius That is to say, they contributed men and money, but ·
not so much nor so many men for each tribe. In other
words, the levy of men and money was made, according to the
original arrangement, pro habitu pecuniarum. In the reconsti-
tuted comitia centuriata, as Livy knew it‚—a voting assemny,
not an army, be it remembered—there was a definite connection
between tribes and centuries, but in what it consistedis not certain.

ΤΙιε local tribeS, the census, the tributum, and the military
establishment according to classes and centuries are alike in
this, that they denote a change from a patrician burgess-body,

cause that Servius needed it: he realised that the patrician
privilege of sels-sacrifice in continual and hard-fought wars was
injurious in itself, and ineffective sor the real accomplishment of
Rome’s ambition. The city was no longer merelya pastoral and
agricultural community: trade had come, by land and water,
and it was only equitable that those who profited should pay
and serve, according to the measure of their ability‚ for the
protection and the assurance os profit.

Livy’s account of the Servian army is examined in detail in
the notes on chapter 43. There are, however, one or two points
which seem to need brief notice here. Hitherto, is they fought
at all, the Plebeians had not served in the ranks of the
legio: henceforth they became liable for legionary service like
