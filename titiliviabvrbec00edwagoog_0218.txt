138 LIVY. I [xxu §5

Tullus, comi stonto, probably refers to the envoys‚ ‘ with a smiling
countenance,' i.e. there was civility on both sideS‚ with design on the
one hand, without it on the other. In some Mss. comiter (a word
common in Livy) is added to comi fronte: perhaps both should be
considered as a gloss to explain blande and bemjgne.
celebrant] ‘ attended in state ’: the word implies the formality of a
festival.
24 priores] ‘ first ' (πρότεροι).
25 in] ‘for,' ‘to begin on’ (like εἰς τρίτην maipa„ cf. 28. 1 in diem
posterum. tricennium] i.e. a month’s notice: cf. 32. 9.
28 ς e. purgando] ⁶ in explanation ² : their statements follow in or. obl.
quiequam] This pronoun follows naturally the negative notion
contained in invitos. For further extensions of its use cf. 18. 1, 35. 3.
P. 29. 1 m reddantur] ‘failing such restitution.’ The tense, like
placeat, reproduces the original statement.

3 ἓ ’1. uter] This is either (ι) relative, answering to eum, ‘ that one
of the tw0, wh0...,’ in which case ut follows directly after facere testes ε οι·
(2) indirect question, governed 'by facere testes, ‘ appeals to the gods to
witness which of the tw0...‚' inwhich case ut is final, ⁶ that 80...)

4 aspernatus] ‘ with disdain.'

5 expetant] The word is found intransitively in Plautus with the
sense of ‘light upon ' as of a punishment: here it seems to be transitive
(as in 23. 4 below), di being understood as the subject, with the sense
of ‘ visit upon,’ i.e. take vengeance on him for the war.

CHAPTER XXIII.

9 ἓ 1.. Lavi-nium] Cf. 1. 11. Alba] Cf. 3. 3.
1 1 ἓ 2. dimicationem] ‘ the struggle.’ The word implies that it was
decisive: cf. 15. 2 dimicatio ultima.
memet] The two clauses thus introduced are of similar character,

but the first is cast in a negative form.

12 tectis dirutis] See ²9· 6.

15 ἓ 8. plus] en, as here, without quam, like amplius: cf. 32. 12
non minus. milla] he acc. (regular m such expressions as this) seems
to denote that the mind crosses the intervening space. passum] for pas-
suum: the form is supported by the evidence of the MSS„ and magis-tratum,
dumvir also occur. ·

16 fossa Cluilia] (Plut. Coriol. 30 Κλοιλεῖαι τάφροι) ran, roughly speaking,

N.E. and S.W.‚ across the Via Appia of a later date.
