in Republican days in the case of the rex sacrorum and other priests.
It may have been an aerolite, associated with Jupiter or Terminus:
St Augustine speaks of a lapis Capitolinus. The oath per Iovem lapidem
(cf. Cicero, ad Fam. vu. ια, and Polybius, lv. 25· 6 Δία. λίθον) is an
evidence of the sanctity of a particular stone of this kind.

⁸ ad meridiem versun] ‘with his face towards the south.’ .

28 ξ 7. comto velato] ‘with his head covered '—by means of a sold of
his robe, the toga praetexta (or trabea) ε see 36. 5, and note. The usage
may have originated at a time when the worshippers dreaded the
sight of deities or departed spirits. The Greek custom, on the other
hand, was to perform religious duties bareheaded.

29· eedem· oepit] Where there was no special enclosure like the augura-
culum, the augur sat in a square tent with one opening, commanding a
view of the templa (see below). ·

30 lituum] ‘ a crook’ : the word is possibly of Etruscan origin, and
seems to be connected with a root lik3 cf. obliquus.

3² . teutones...determ1nav1t] ‘ defined the boundaries,' i.e. divisions of
the sky for purposes of augury.. This he did with his lituus, marking
across the sky one imaginary line (decumanum) from E. to W., and
another (cardo) from N. to S. The space of sky thus intersected was
called templum, i.e. a precinct cut off (from root tam, ‘ cut‚’ cs. τέμενος).
Then a similar templum was, marked off on the earth by a certain
formula (concepttlr verbi-r), i.e. by naming definite objects (trees or
land-marks) as limits. -

Notice the augural significance of the templum, which Festus (v. -1 57)
describes as locus ita effatus (i.e. concsptis verbis) aut ita saeptus (by en-
closure) ut una parte pateat angulosque adfixos habeat ad terram. sanum,
on the other hand, means a locality consecrated by ponttfices: and the
claims os any sana or sacella had to be satisfied by exauguratio before
the inauguratio and consecratio of a templum on the same spot could
take place. Thus a fanum was not necessarily a templum, nor a templum
a sanum.

. domu...dixit] ‘ appointed the right sections ·to be towards the
south, the left towards the north.'

P· 25. 2 signum contramanmo finivit] (cf. 10. 6 animo metatus) ‘in
front of him he set an imaginary (animo) limit-mark.' This would be
one os the four land-marks of the templum on earth.

4 ς 8. translato] ‘ passed,' ‘ shifted 'z as a bishop would pass his
staff from his right hand to his lest before giving a blessing. ·
