century B.c., (α) shortly after 390 ιο. See the article Topography os
Rome, in the Companion to Latin Studia.

24 pomerium] According to the general interpretation of the passage
from Varro in the last note, this word seems to mean first of all the
‘ boundary line ' itself, marked off (see Tac. Anu. ΧΗ. 24) by stonee at
intervals. Then (cf. Gen. vl11. 14. 1) it is the ‘circuit-spaoe’ inside the
wall, important for defensive communication. See Introduction, fi 4.

profert] ‘ extends.' Such extension was a sovereign's prerogative:
after Servius Tullius there was no instance thereos till Sulla beoeme
dictator, and even the Aventine (though within the Servian Wall)
was not included within the pomerium till the reign of the Emperor
Claudius. Χ

5 4. verbi vim wluin] ‘the mere etymology.’

pannosi-lum] ‘ ‘nner passage '—‘behind’ the wall from the enemy’s
point of view, pro ected by it ε whereas ammomum means ‘double
passage,’ i.e. the circuit-space on both sides of the wall. ambitus
is similarly used in the case of private houses. Livy is probably wrong
in his statement here, as the other authorities invariably refer pomerium
to the inner side only. For the form pomerium cf. pomen‘dianus.

26 Etrusca] The pomerium is attributed, like many other ancient
oeff‘l.inances mentioned in this book, to the Etruscans; but it is probably
mser to suppose that in this and other cases the Latins and Etrusca-ns
followed a common tradition.

27 eorus...term1ms] ‘with definite Emit-marks on either side' (of the
wall): the circuit-spaces were defined by stones (cippi, laptiles) at
intervaIS, ,and the area thus enclosed formed a templum, within which
auspices could be taken. circa is adjectival: cf. 17. 4 multarum circa
civitatium, and see n. on Praef. 2 novi semper.

inaugurato] Cf. 36. 3 above.

29 continuarentur] ‘carried up to': coniungunt] ‘build into.’ The
subject is easily understood from vulgo.

30 nuri...ou1tu] ‘free from human occupation’: ef. ovid, Md. ιιι. 709
purus ab arboribus campus.

31 ἕ ὀ. habitari] refers to the inner, anri to the outer circuit. “⁸02
expresses the feeling of the Romans.

p. 58. 3 tormm...prorerebantur] See note on ἕ 3 above.

CHAPTER XLV.

4 5 1.. macutum] ‘by the enlargement': the increase of the city
necessarily follows the increase os citizenship.
