meu] Various reasons were given for his escape—advocacy of
peace, enmity towards Paris and Priam, betrayal os the city, covenant
with the Greeks after the capture.
. Antenori] He had entertained Menelaus and Odysseus when they
came on an embassy (Iliad 111. 203), and thus gained his salvation
vetusti iure hospitii: his house was saved from pillage by a panther·
skin hung before the door. As the traditional founder of Patavium
(cf. Virgil, Αεηαιᾈ, 1. 242—9), the birthplace of Livy, he has a special
claim to a place in this record. Tacitus (Arm. xvl. υ) mentions games
at Patavium founded by Antenor.

fuorunt] fiacr-int might have been expected, under the influence of

Ρ ⁵ the oratio obliqua, introduced by constat, but fierunt (in fact, all the

(

12

clause from et vetusti) is Livy’s own statement.

ome ius bem aix-nnuman] ‘ waived the full right of war? i.e.

destruction of the men, enslavement of the women and children. Cf.
Cicero, de Off. 1. 1 1. 3 5 parta autem victoria, conservandi ia· qui non
crudeles in bello, non immanes fuerunt.
. δ 2. Enetum] gen. pl. Livy gives here that account of the Veneti
which .is parallel to the Trojan traditions of early Rome: other
authorities believed the Veneti to be connected with the Gallie tribe ot
the same name, while Herodotus (v. 9) regarded them as Illyrians.
It is possible that the connection of Antenor and Trojans with this
part of Italy represents (as in the case of Aeneas) a Pelasgian mi·
gration.

mommo] He is mentioned as the leader of the Paphlagoniam in
Iliad 11. 851, and as slain by Menelaus in v. 579. md Troiam. ‘by,’
‘ near Troy.'

ἓ 8. Euganeis] In the time of the elder Pliny they were still a
separate people; and the hills between Patavium (Padua) and Verona are
still known as Colli Euganei. Sidonius Apollinaris calls Livy’s writings
Euganeae chartae.

Θ m quem...1ocum...vooatur] The relative has atnacted its substantive

mto its own case: cf. Ter. Eun. 653 eunuchum quem dedisti nobis, quas
turbas dedit! Virg. Aen. 1. 57 3 urbem quam statuo, vestra- est. See
Roby‚ δ 450·

Troiano] This dative is usual in the case of names, and is best
explained as due to attraction. Servius says: dicimus et ⁸ nomen mihi
est Cicero’ et ‘ Ciceronis ’ et ‘ Ciceroni ’.· melius tamen dativo. Below in
ἕ· 5, Troia is an instance os the nominative.

13 univorsa] ‘ as a whole.’
