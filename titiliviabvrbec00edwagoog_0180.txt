100 Ι LIVY. I [vn §3

8 Euandro] See n. on 5. 2. Here, as before, he serves as the
authority for introducing a Greek cult.

9 §⁴- Geryone] a three-headed king who lived in Spain, according
to the common legend. By a strange coincidence there was a Geryonis
oraculum at Patavium, Livy’s birth-place (cf. Suet. Tib. 14), which
may indicate that according to another legend Geryon belonged to
Italy.

mira specle] ‘ of rare beauty ἐ cf. 45. 4 bos...miranda...specie.

1 1 qua] 6 at a point where.’

12 laeto] 6 rich ἐ cf. Juv. x11. ¹3 laeta Clitumni pascua.

13 et tpsum1=xat αὐτόν, implying here something unusual, and leading
up to the next point: see n. on Praef. 3. Propertius (Ν. 9. 4) has
et statuit fessos fessus et ipse boves.

¹4 ἕ ὀ. oppressisset] ‘ came upon ⁹ τ-κατέλαβεν. sopor, the deep
sleep os the weary.

15 cacus] See n. on Herculi above.

16 avertere] here 6 raid‚’ 6 lift ἐ below aversos has the literal meaning,
‘ tail first.’ Cf. Propertius, lv. 9. 12 aversos cauda traxit in antra boves:
Virgil, Aen. VI11. 209, 210 atque llos, ne qua forent pedibus vestigia rectis,
cauda in speluncam tractos. The trick was practised by Hermes when
he stole the cattle of the gods: cf. Hom. Hymn. 4. 76 ἴχνι’ ἀποστρέψας.

17 quaerentem...0ra.nt] ‘must have brought the owner to the cave in
his search.' The fut. part. with sum contains all the meanings of μέλλω.

18 deducere] here, as often, connotes ‘to the proper place.’

boves, exim-lum quemque] The plural is immediately restricted by
a singular in apposition. eximium is in sense a superlative, and thus
naturally coupled with quemque ι cf. Cic. in V. 1v. 142 egregium
quemque.
Θ ξ 8. numero] dative: abesse is used by Livy with the sense and
government of deesse, 6 to be wanting.’

22 ⁸1 forte]=et πως, 6 (to see) if,’ ‘ in case ἐ cf.- 57. α. eo...ferrent] ‘led
thither,’ i.e. tended in the direction of the cave: not ‘led him ibium:
which would be nonsense with pergit ad proximam speluncam. eo may
connote here, as in line 18 above, the place desired, i.e. where the oxen
were.

2 3 forae] 6 outwardS.’ nec ln partem aliam] ‘and only in the one
direction ’ (i.e. towards his resting-place).

24 ineertue amm-l] animi is locative: cf. 58. 9 aegram animi, also
lv. 57. 3 incertus sententiae, and xxxvl. 42. 6 incertus consilii.

25 porro] ‘on,' ‘sarthen’
