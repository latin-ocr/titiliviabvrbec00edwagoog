yet ruled. A Servius Tullius may have been, in a sense, the
parent of the Republic3 and even the TarquinS, by depressing·
the patricians, incidentally advanced the people.

There was nothing new, then, in the fabric of the republican
constitution: but the change in the tenure of the' imperium made
all the difference in the working of the machinery of state.

The traditions which tell of conquests and colonies in the
regal period, of a definite assumption of leadership in the Latin
League, and a reorganisation of the Roman army on a larger
basiS, may exaggerate or anticipate the truth: but the state of
things which they imply is comprehensible enough. It was
an age of frequent, almost continuous, warfare3 the Latin
communities were striving against one another, and Rome,
strengthened, perhaps created,by Sabine chieftains,was beginning
to realise her strategic position and her imperial possibilitieS.
Meanwhile, for the kings who had eyes to see beyond the Tiber,
the growth of Etruscan wealth and power threatened a far more
serious struggle, in which a united Latium might barely hold
its own, and a disunited Latium must inevitably be destroyed.
What actually happened we cannot tell: it may well be that
for a while Rome and the Latin communities os which she was
already in some sort the leader fell under Etruscan rule3 and
when that rule was weakened and withdrawn, probably under
pressure from Greeks¹ in the south and Gauls in the north, the

” city-state' of Rome essayed anew, under republican auspiceS,

the task of dividing and conquering its neighbours.

¹ In the battle of Aricia, which probably took place about the end
of the sixth century, the Campanian Greeks and the Latius won a
decisive victory over the EtruscanS. The Romans took no part in' it:
but this is not surprising, if they were at the time under Etruscan
domination. Cf. De Sanctis, 1. p. 452. The hold of the Etruscans on
Campania was loosened or lost when their sea-power was broken by
Hier0, king of Syracuse, in a victory off Cumae in 474 B.C.
