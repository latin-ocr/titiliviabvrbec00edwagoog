civita-s: sine suffragio (Aul. Gellius, xvl. 13): afterwards the phrase
in tabulas Caeritum referri became equivalent to partial disfranchisement.

nimio plus] ‘far more’= cf. 11. 37. 4 nimio plus quam velim:
xxm. 33. 4 multitudine, quae nimio maior erat. A colloquial use,
common in Plautus: cs. our ‘far and away.’

7 haud granum] ‘ without reluctance’ : the form gravatim (rare for,
gravate) is due to a false analogy with old fem. accusatives like partim,
statim.

14 nme] The evidence of archaeology supports the statement here
made. Traces of Etruscan occupatiori have been discovered in the Po
valley‚ on the Adriatic sea-ward, in the territory of the Volsci, in
Campania, in Rome itself, in Corsica, and perhaps in Sardinia. It is
‚not certain whether they expanded from the north after a land-migration
to Italy, or came to Etruria by sca, and thence moved outwardS, north
and south. The ancient authoritieS, Herodotus (1. 94). Strabo (p. ⁰²19)
and Velleius Paterculus (1. 1), hold the latter view, which seems the more
probable. Their history is made up of conflicts with their neighbours
—Ligurian5‚ Umbrians, Greek semem, GauIS‚ and Romans. To them-
selves they were Rasennas (cf. Dion. Hal. Ι. 30. 3 αὐτοὶ μέντοι σφᾶς
αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ἡγεμόνων τινὸςῬασ-έννᾳ. τὸν αὑτὸν ἐκείνῳ τρόπον ὀνομάζουσι),
from which by some such form as T u-Rasena, Τανεεηα, Τυρσηνοί may
have come: to the Umbrians they were Strangers (Etruscus, Etruria
are supposed to be derived from Umbrian etru=alter). They were, a's
Livy states, a maritime power 3 they developed a sea-trade, and fought
as allies of Carthage against the Phocaeans (536 Β. C.) and against
Cumae (474)-
