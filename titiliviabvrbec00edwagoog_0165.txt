- ι ξ 8] NOTES 85

5 4. ab] gives the occasion of the departure, implying both
sequence and consequence (cf. ἐξ).

15 - ducentibus ntis] Aeneas is always the ‘ Man of Destiny.’

in moniam] i-e. to Aenea, on the west coast of Chalcidice.

ι 7 mma] intransitive, ‘steered for’: so elsewhere in Livy (e.g.
xxxl. 45. 14 Cassandream petentes, primo ad Mendin tenuere), and
in Ovid (e.g. Met. 1'1. 140 medio tutta-simus ibis-...inter utrumque tene).
Cf. Soph. Phil. 220 τίνες ποτ’ εἰς γῆν τήνδε...κατέσχετε;

p. 4. 1 ἓ ⁸. ut quibus] See n. on ut quae, Praef. 4.

ab hammo prope] For ab see n. above. pr0pe=fere‚ an apology
for the use of immenso in a figurative sense: the same adjective needs
no apology in Praef. 4, where it has its literal meaning. -

2 mpero-not] Most MSS. have superessent, which, if accepted, would
be a construction to suit the sense, i.e. nihilpraeter arma et naves=arma
et naves.

4 Aborigines] The name suggests its own derivation from ab ortssgoe'ne—
ὥσπερ ἂν ἡμεῖς εἴποιμεν γενεάρχας ἦ πρανπνγόυους, as Dionysius says
(1. ιο), or more simply ol ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς. The usual Greek spelling of the
name is ’Δβορι-γΐνες, but a variant form Ἀβερριγῖνες (i.e. wanderers), is
given by Dionysius. On the question of their identity, see the Introduction.

6 ἓ 0. inde] ‘from this point.' The first version is given in the
Aeneid (last six books): Livy agrees with Virgil for the most part in this
opening chapter.

5 ’1. emerem] Probably the subjunctive here is due to the oratio
obliqua: but Livy affects it with prius quam, even where little or no
notion of anticipation is implied. The verb is probably intransitive:
‘sounded.' .

9 primores] ⁸ the front rankS.’

1 1 protecti] essent may be understood from the previous clause, or
(better) the phrase unde...profecti may be taken as qualifying emissent.
For the conti-acted form cf. 7. 7 mag-issent.

Θ 5 ο. anatem] This use osa primary tense in the midst of an oratio
obliqua, and following historic tenses (essent, exissent), is an example of
repraesentatio, or a reproduction of the tense of the oratio recta—in this
case audiit. Livy frequently admits such variations from the hard and
fast ‘ rule ⁹ of oratio obliqua ι in all probability he desired to retain the
tenses of the oratio recta, but was hampered by the limited tense-
capacities of the subjunctive mood. This is the view of Dr R. S.
Conway, set forth in a useful appendix to his edition of Book 11., from
which the following general principles are quoted ε
