92 LIVY. I [ιιι ξ 11

were originally believed-to be the wives os the fite—god, and the old Latin
kings were accordingly regarded as born of this divine father and these
human motherS. (Cf. Frater, op. cit.‚ p. υ 1.)

CHAPTER lv.

p. 7. ι 5 1.. debebatur fatis] ‘was destined by fate) satis is
probably ablative: cf. Virg. Aen. vu. 120 fatis mihi debita tellus. For
sata cf. 1. 43 7. 113 7. 15.

2 seeundum] ‘next to.’

5 8. vi...edidlsoet] ‘ had suffered violence, and become the mother
of twins) ’

4 numm...] Notice that neither alternative admits the divine
paternity—a touch of scepticism on Livy’s part.

5 incertae] ‘disputed,' ⁸ unassigned’: the epithet belongs not to
stirps but to the circumstances of the sentence, being really equivalent ·
to quod incerta res erat.

6 ς 8. nee dl neo hominen] i. e. the father, whether divine or human:
⁴ no divine or human agency.’

9 ὅ 4. forte quadam divinitus] ⁴ by a divine dispensation, as we may
say ’—a translation of θείᾳ τινὶ τύχῃ in Livy’s own style, adjective
-l- adverb. ’

fiberu...dtbat] Tiberis is the subject throughout. The phrase
ad iusti...amnis, ‘to the regular water-way‚' is not awkward if the‘
personality of the river is borne in mind. spem governs posse...insantes:
the king’s servants were anxious to fulfil the letter and not the spirit
of his orders. nec...et: the two clauses are like in character, but the
first is cast in a negative form: cf. 23. 23 28. 5. quamvis languida,
‘however sluggish,’ cf. 16. 5 quamvis magnae3 for the epithet cf. Hor.
oei. 11. 14. 17 ater flumine languido Cocytus errans.

13 §³- alluvie] ⁴ pool ’ ; nowhere else so used. eluvie (⁸ overssow ')
has been suggested.

fieus Ruminalis...nomularem] So Ovid, Fasti 11. 411—2 arbor
erat .· remanent vestigia, quaeque vocatur Rumina nunc ficus Romula
ficus erat. According to Festus (p. 270) Ruminalis means ‘quod sub
arbore ea lupa mammam dedit Romulo et Remo, mamma autem rumis
dicitur’: and there was a goddess Rumina, the guardian os nursing
mothers. More probably the word is connected (like ruma, rumis)
with the root sru (= ‘stream,’ ‘flow’); and so means ⁸(the fig) by the
stream ἰ in this connection it may be noted that Rumffn was an ancient
name of the Tiber (cf. Servius on Aen. vlu. 63 and 90), and Roma
