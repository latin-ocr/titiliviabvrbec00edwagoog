a ritual reason and justification for the adoption by Servius
Tullius of the ancient Suovetaurilia for the purification of
Rome’s field of fighting men. -

In conclusion, it is to be noted once more that what is related

in view: the foundations of Rome are broadened and so
strengthened.

certain stages in the development of Rome. lt now remains
to consider briefly the causes which may have contributed to the
decline and fall of the kingship itself, and to note evidences
of the regal principle in the institutions and constitution of
the Republic.

According to Livy (1. 60), the last Tarquin king was exiled,
after Sextus’ deed of shame, and the consulate was substituted
for the kingship, in a moment, as it were: the idea of two
consuls was taken ex comment-artis· Servi Tulli, and a republic
replaced a monarchy as easily as in Portugal a year ago. In
this traditional account, however, two points are to be dis-
tinguished—the exile of the Tarquins, and the creation of
consuls· Why then were the Tarquins expelled? Was it the
result of tyrannical oppression and outrage: or was it because
