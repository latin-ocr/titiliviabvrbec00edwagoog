ready means of largess to the neediest personS, whenever he chose.'

For the localities mentioned in this chapter, the map qs Rome
should be consulted.

p. 62. ι qum hoe...rei esti] Cf. 41. 1.

4 5 2. cum me] sc. dixis-set.

6 potiorem] ‘ preferable ' (from the point of view of the nobles): yet
in the adoption and the succession of Tarquinius Priscus himself there
were many points of similarity to the case of Servius.

mum] i.e. Servius.

per licentiam explains eludentem, which is in agreement with illum.

9 regnaturum qui vicisset] ⁸ that the conqueror would be king!

ipse propo exea-ucula] After these words the Mss. have cum
semianimis regib comitatu domum se reciperet pervenissetque ad summum
Cyprium (ἲ) vicum, a duplication (with the exception of three wordS,
semianimis regio comitatu) of a sentence found in 5 6, to which context it
clearly belongs. Of the three words which are not doubled we may
dismiss semianimis as superfluous with exsanguis: regio comitatu ought
perhaps to be retained as a genuine survival from some such clause as
cum regio comitatu domum se reciperet, which caused the confusion by its
similarity to a clause in 5 6.

18 reverlta...v1rorum] She had no compunction in enter-ing a formal
assembly of men—a breach os matronly decorum.
