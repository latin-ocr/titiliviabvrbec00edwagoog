of the augurs, which explains the archaic form adclarassis, really an
aorist optative: cf. n. on ausim, Praef. 1. .
8 peregit verbis] ‘formally recited’—using a form of words: cs. 32. 8.
auspicia] Auspices granted thus in answer to prayer were known as
impetrita or impetrativa. By associating the auspices with the accession
of Numa, Livy emphasizes their importance in the life of Rome. They
were indeed one of the most jealously guarded privileges of the
PatricianS‚ who did nothing, private or public, nisi auspicato, So
auspicium representS, here and elsewhere, the⁸ divine sanction of
imperium. - .
9 declaratus] an official word, ‘returned,’ ‘declared ’ as elected.
tommo] i.e. ‘the enclosure,' as explained above.

of peace. For this use of the demonstrative is, to reestablish a sentence
after pause or interruptim, cf. 49. 9 ei Mamilio, 58. 11 cultrum, quem...

Vesta is the ‘hearth·goddess’—the one representing the first approach of
the house, the other its last or inmost sanctity. Thus explained,
Janus is the god of beginning, mentioned first in prayer (as Vesta
is mentioned last) ; his favour was sought at the outset of all enterpriseS,
and his door was left open in war, that his watchful eye might follow the
fortunes of his worshippers. Cf. Fowler, R. F. pp. 282—289.

But this explanation of the form and attributes of Ianus is rejected
by those who see in him the partner and consort of Diana, and regard
the pair as duplicates of Jupiter and Jun0‚ deriving all four words from
the root di, ‘bright‚’ from which come also Zeus and Dione. When the
various Latin tribes were associated to form one city, their various cults
were associated also, Those who hold this view go on to derive ianua
from Ianus-3 thus a ianua jbris is a door guarded by a Ianus, or perhaps,
