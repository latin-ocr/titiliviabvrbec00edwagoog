INTRODUC T ION xxxiii

Rome may belong to the foundation of the first (palatine) city
or to the fusion of Romans and Sabines. The word curia (see
note on c. ¹3· 6) came to mean both a meeting-place for cere-
monial purposes¹ and a district or corporation: and though
members of the same curia may in general have dwelt in the ”
same quarter, it seems that these associations of families, for
such they were, like the φρατρίαι in Greece, originated rather
in mutual protection and common worship than in any con-
nection of residence. When a larger unit, the state, undertook
the duty of protection, the curiae contributed each its quota
(centuria) for the levy (legio) ε and similarly, while the special
rites of each curia in honour of Iuno &cirins (which seem to
suggest a Sabine origin) continued, the whole people celebrated
together, according to their curiae, certain other rites (eg. the
Fornacalia and the Fordicidia). The curiae were, in, fact, the
formal units of the state until the reorganisation of Servius
Tullius· To be enrolled in a curia was the warrant of citizen-
ship3 and the formalities of adoption (adrogatio) and of testament
could only be performed before the assembled curias—the
comitia curiata.

The three centuries of knights (Titienses, Ramnenses,
Luceres), included by Livy among the institutions of Romulus'·
foundation, seem to be identical with the 300 Celeres. Livy
does not here connect the three centuries with the three
traditional tribes bearing the same name, and supposed by
ancient writers² to have been created by Romulus after the death
of Tatius, Discussion has wearied itself over the possible origins
of the three tribes3-indeed, it is not certain whether tribus has

Pelham ( sse Roman Curiam in his Essays, 191 1) takes the opposite
view. He connects the curia with the Sabine conquerorS, and considers
that it means a threefold organisation—(r) military3 (α) territorial, i..e
groups of consortes, occupying land granted for military service, and
forming corporations with curiones, flamines, and sacra; (3) political,
