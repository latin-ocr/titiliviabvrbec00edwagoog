was not without design.’ The different stages in popular feeling are
clearly outlined in successive sentences: (ι) panio, (2) reconsideration,
(3) indignation, (4) communication-

6 ἓ 7. praeco] It was the duty of the praecona, as state-heralds, to
attend (apparere) certain magistrateS, to summon the people (as here) to
contiones or comitia, to summon senators to the Senate House (see c. 47.
8, and cf. Suetonius, Claud. 36).

'ad tribunum celerum] Whatever the origin of the Celeres (see
c. 15. 8)—some authorities are inclined to connect their origin and their
disappearance· with the rise and fall of Etruscan influence-it would
seem that by their close association with the king’s person their com-
mandant became a sort of king's deputy: his relationship towards the
king was (or was supposed to be) analogous to that of the magister
equitum towards the dictator (magister populi) of Republican times.
The tribunus Celerum therefore combined military and civil functions—
the command of the cavalry (or even of the whole army), and the
presidency (if deputed by the king) of comitia and senate (i.e. of
concilium and consilium).

8 ς Β. οίιιε...1.ιιεοῑι11αιιθ] ‘characterised by the feeling and capacity.'
Here the particular kind (eius) is of so inferior a degree as almost to
express absence of real ‘ feeling’ and ‘capacity.’ fuerat denotes a state

11 'ri-itanum] a surname in the gens Lucretia: cf. 111. 8. 2, lv. 30. 4.

12 esset] subjunctive to denote Brutus' statement.
13 5 0. lu tonsas...demersae] ‘buried alive (kept underground) for the
excavation of channels and sewerS.’

14 Romanos...faetos] The oratio obliqua follows easily from the
previous clauses describing the speech of BrutuS.

15 opifices ac lapicidas] ‘mechanics and masonsss

16 ἕ 10. memorata] i.e. by BrutuS, and likewise invocati below.
media] So the best MSS„ and the form is justified by a good many
paralleIS, e.g. 1. 1 1 stirpis

17 invecta...n11a] ‘the act of the daughter in driving her chariot of
crime over her father’s body.’

18 dl] either gods in general, or the ‘special powers presiding over
vengeance for parentS, the parentum ficriae mentioned below.

. 19 ξ 11. quae...sub101t] ‘suggested by the palpable iniquity of the

position, but by no means easy for the historian to reproduce.' praesens
rerum indignitas certainly refers to the immediate surroundings of

Brutus, not of Livy, who had, so far as we knOW, no grounds of censure
