196 LIVY. I' [va1§6

31 5 0. ferox] not ‘spirited Tullia’ but ‘the Tullia who had spirit,’ as
distinguished from the gentler sister. '

· nihilmad audeam] ‘no stufl‘ for ambition or enterprise.’

p. 60. 3 muliebri...audadn] ‘was wanting in enterprise as a woman’
—she had not the ’γυναικὸς ἀνδρόβουλον ἐλπίζον κέαρ of a Clytae-
mnestra.

6 §⁸²- meni] ‘the other-’s’ mroere...mtendm]ssQle
de viro...virum] ‘about her husband to his brother, about her sister to
her sister’s husband.'

8 ne...v1duam...ea011bem] ‘without a husband'...‘without a wife.’

9 iungi] In this apparently irregular sentence 'the meaning is clear
enough. Tullia is unsuitably married: she feels that she would have
been better off unmarried. The construction as it stands is an elabora·
tion, best explained step by step. rectius may be taken as an adjective
or an adverb z if an adjective it is equivalent to magis· rectum, and
supplies a predicate to the two infinitive phrases se...ftcturumsuisse, cum
impari iungi ; if an adverb, it has a predicative force (‘ it would have
been juster that ²...) which, properly belonging to se...fiaeturum fuisse,
is extended to cum impari iungi. On the whole, it seems preferable to
take it as an adjective. As a direct statement then the sentence might
run rectius [est] caelibem fuisse quam cum impari iungi. futurum ficisse
gives the first infinitive a potential force (cf. ἂν with aor. infin. in Greek),
expressing a possibility now past ι iungi is present, not perfect, because
the effect of the marriage continues into th'e present. Then contendere
(⁴ she would maintain ') turns the whole expression into oratio obliqua ε
we might render it—-‘ she would maintain it as fairer for herself and him
to have had the chance, now past, of being unmarried, than to be in fact
wedded to an inferior.'

η ξ 8. videat] For the tense see n. on 1. 8 audierit.

ὦ auae...imp10t] With implere Livy uses the genitive (to express the
thing supplied, as a secondary object, cf. Roby, 5 5 30) rather than the
ablative. .

ἓ 0. Arruns] So the Mss. Lucius, which seems to be required for
the sake of consistency, may be the correct reading, lost by a copyist's
confusion of words or persons. If we retain Arruns we must suppose
either (1) that Livy has made a slip in detail: or (α) that the clause
A rruns..secissent refers to the victimS, a view which scarcely suits the
meaning of the wordS‚ disagrees with Dionysius (who says that the
younger Tullia was the violent one), and requires a very awkward
change of subject for iunguntur.
