e.g. Most. 996 sum circum vectus: ita ubi nunc sim nescio: cf. >also
tanta in c'. 3. 1 of this book. . .

27 ἓ 12.“ desiderium...omn1a] ‘a craving for the ruin of oneself and
one’s environment by wilful waste.’ luxuria is the spirit os extrava-
gance which manifests itself in luxus, Tacitus tells the contrary tale

. of the Germans (Cornu 19): nemo enim illic vitia ridet, nec corrumpere
et corrumpi saeculum vocatur.

29 cum forsitan *necessariae erunt] cum is temporal‚ and answers
tum quidem z forsitan expresses an afterthought‚ or parenthesis (ι as
perhaps they will be ') to the sentence, and has no effect on the mood of
erunt: nor has it in 53. 9 beloW‚’ where it occurs at the head of a
sentence. in oratio obliqua. Cf. lx, 1 1. 13 et illi quidem, forsitan et
publica, sua certe liberata fide, ab Caudio in castra Romana inviolati
redierunt ,· Cic. Fam. 1.,8. 2 ut quibusdam forsitan videor (where forsitan
= ‘and perhaps I do ’); Sall. lug. 114 incertae ac forsitan paulo post
interiturae vitae parcet-53 PropertiuS‚ 1¹. 15. 54 fhrsitan includet crastina
fata dies. The use of quamvis with adjectives' is similar.

taking?

30 518. potum] is renewed in libentius. ‘fa'r sooner, far more
willingly would I have begun)

31 precationibus] So Demosthenes begins his speech ‘On the Crown'
πρῶτον μέν, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, τοῖς θεοῖς εὔχομαι πᾶσι καῖ ‘tr-datus: and
the Roman orators, as we see in several of Cicero’ s speecheS‚ made
similar appeals3 so that Servius says (on Aen. x1.3or) maiores nullam .
orationem nasi invocatis numinibus incohabant. ·

33 tantum] So the best MSS.· some editors read tanti, which would
make orsis a substantive (= ‘beginnings')‚ a later usage except inthe ,
sense of ‘words.’ ·

CHAPTER Ι.

(On the traditions contained in chapters I.—7-V11. see Introduction, 53.) ‚

P· 3. 1 ἓ 1. iam...omn1um] The phrase expresses both the transition
from the Preface to the History‚ and the first point which Livy wishes

to introduce, ‘To begin at the beginning‚’
satie contat] ‘it is commonly agreed' (as a tradition, not as a
certainty).

 

in eeteros] qualified by duobuS, ‘in two cases.’ The dat. after

abstinuisse is unusual.
