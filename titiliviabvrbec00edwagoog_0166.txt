86 LJVY. J [1 §8

' A. In passages of Oratio Obliqua in which Livy is using Primary
Tenses aster a past governing Verb, the Primary Tenses appear, as a
rule, only where they are actually retained from the Oratio Recta ; i.e.
(1) all retainable Tenses are retained with great regularity ,- but (α)
where a change aff T ense is unavoidable (as in converting the Imperative
and the Future of the Oratio Recta), there Livy's usage varies, but the

' Teme chosen is most ‹fien Secondary.

B. (1) The Subjunctives which depend directly upon the Main
Verb which introduces the Oratio obliqua, take the regular Sequence ,-
thus, they are Secondary aster a Past Τ ense, whether or not the Rimary
T enses are retained in the body of the speech itseffl

(α) Similarly the Imperfect Suffunctive which is regularly used to
give a Past Command throws any Verbs that may depend upon it into
Secondary‘ Tenses ; ancl this influence sometimes extends even into the
next sentence.

Θ condendaeque urbis locum] a genitive of description: cf. 15. 63
47. 8; 48. 9; lx. 45. 18 oratores pacis petendae. urbi is also read, in
which case the dative expresses a notion of object or of ‘ work contem·
plated ’ (Roby 5 481): cf. v. 54. 4 urbi condendae locum elegerun& xxx.
22. 6 locum condendo oppido ceperunt.

· nobilitatem] ‘ renown.’

16 beno...paratum] dat. of indirect object: cf. xxvl. 12. 13 dixit se et
Campanos paratos eruptioni fore.

18· 5 9. ictum] Strictly speaking it was the victim‚ not the treaty,
which was ‘ struck,’ but the object of the action passes into the result ι
cf. ‘ strike (hands upon) a bargain.'

20 penates deon] ⁸ household gods ' (perhaps connected with penus,
‘ store-room ' ε cf. penetralia). Livy thus admits a 'prehistoric origin for
the very ancient rites of the Penates (and Vesta) at Lavinium, which
every consul, dictator, and praetor, at the beginning and the end of his
office, was bound to celebrate. Lavinium was in effect the religious
metropolis of the Latin communities and of Rome, and retained its
importance as such until the fall of paganism.

22 ἕ 10. utaque] ‘ undoubtedly,’ ‘ at any rate ’τ implying previous
uncertainty.

stabili...sedo] ‘ in a sure and certain settlement ἐ the two epithets
are often found together.

2 3 ἓ 11. oppidum] ‘town ἐ the urbs was yet to come.
25 stirpis] This alternative form for stirps (cf. plebs and plebis) occurs
