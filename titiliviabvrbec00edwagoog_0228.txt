5 11) takes the latter view, but Dionysius the former. Cf. Seeley,
Introd., p. 43.

P. 35. 1 decoratum...1noedenteni] ‘ trophy·laden and triumphant, in
victorious progress.' victoria probably belongs to all three words.
ovantem here (as in 11. 2, 2 5. 13) has a general sense: in later times it
was generally used for the lesser triumph (πεζὸς θρίαμβος), in which the
victor entered the city on foot.

3 suh furca. vinctum] ‘tied up to a yoke (fork)‚’ i.e. a piece of wood
V·shaped, to which the criminal’s arms were tied for scourging.

4 quod...=bectacu1um] ΤΙιε apposition gives a reason for the roet of
the clause—‘ so foul were the scene.’

5 ἓ u 1, lictor] The father's appeal quotes once more the words
of the law, with a certain irony, to which the word a· lends itself. Cf.
Martial, 11. 6. 1, i nunc, edere me iube libellos.

1 1 sua decora] ‘ the distinctions he himself has won 't sua is emphatic.
See n. on sua, 7. 15. ·

13 ἓ 12. parem] ‘even,’ ‘consistent.’

14 admiratione...causae] ahl.. 91 cause. The reason for the acquittal
was subjective, not objective 3 patriotism, not justice.

15 manifesta] ‘undisputed‚' ‘flagrant’ (cf. n. on manifestae reum caedis,
7. 9). The tamen which follows implies a contrast between the openness
of the murder, prohibiting compensation‚ and the compensation which
in spite of all was allowed..

16 pecunia publica] ‘ by a sum paid to the state.’ publuoepractically=

. publii-ata, ‘ confiscated ἐ cf. censeo publicandas eorum pecunias, Sall.
Cat. 51. 43. .

17 ὅ 18. sacrincflfl] to suno Sororia and sanus Curiatius (or Jupiter
Τ igillus) (Festus, p. 297): referred to in Tac. Ann. ΧΠ. 8, sacra ex
legibus Tulli regis piaculaque. ‘ Perhaps the whole legend of Horatius,
or at any rate its connexion with this spot [the sororium tigillum] arose
out of this gentile worship of two deities, of which the cult-titles were
respectively Curiatius and Sororia! Fowler, R. F. p. 239.

19 tigillo] ‘a beam in miniature ἐ it was let into houses on both sides of
a street leading from the Carinae to the Vicus CupriuS. See n. ‘on
sepulcrum, below. .

volut nuh iugum] ‘under the fiction of a yoke.' What the yoke
meant is not clear. Weissenborn thinks that Horatius was made thus
to indicate that as an enemy he had forfeited his life ι Roscher (Lex. 5. v.
Ianus) that evil was got rid of by passing through split wood, of which
the iugum was a symbol.
