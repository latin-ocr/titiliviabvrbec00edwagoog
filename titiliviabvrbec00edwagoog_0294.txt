μέλλω ἰιι Greek) a convenient means of indicating all shadae of intention

ι and futurity ε cf. 111. 60. 8, v. 43. 1.

1 ς 8. enimvero] ‘then of a truth,' like καὶ κάρτα. This corroborative
force of enimvero appears likewise in v· α 5. 6 enimvero illud se tacere
suam conscientiam non pati.

19 §⁹- mdlcta muna] ‘without a hearing.’ indictus (επακ dictus)
must be distinguished from indictus, the pf. part. pass of indico, which
occurs in 3 5. 2.

ut...memretur] This sentence is a striking instance os Livy's
fondness for accumulation: six separate items are worked into the
description. See note on ια. 10.

ἰο ad eaput] ‘at the well-head'= cf. Die-est, me. 20. 1 ἓ 8 caput aquae

illud est, unde aqua nascimr. aquae Ferentinae] See n. on 50. 1.

CHAPTER LII.

2 3 θ 1. Turnum nova-ntem ree] ‘the revolutionary attempt of Turnus':
see n. on 51. 3 re nova.
pro manifesto pammac] amplifies merita, ⁸ in view of his flagrant
treason.' For this meaning of parricidium see n. on 13. 2: the word
was used of Tarquin by Turnus in 50. 5.

in ee...tenee.ntu.r] not ‘were bound by that treaty ' (unless we
accept the reading ao for in eo), but ‘were included in that treaty.’ The
substance of the treaty is given in c. 24. 3, but no mention is made
there of colonieS. Perhaps Livy is using, without regard to historical
accuracy‚ the phrase usual in historical times.
29 cessent] almost has the sense of a passive, ‘was handed over,’ with
which ab Tullo would be natural.
utilitatis...oeou The >order of words throws a stress upon
utilitatis. Livy not infrequently wo s (e. g. omnium here)
