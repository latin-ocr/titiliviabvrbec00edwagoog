connection between the T arquins and Etruria. Peaceful relations must
have been interrupted for a time by the war mentioned in c. 42. α. Or
are we to suppose that Tusci here means something different from
Etrusci?

6 Iovis templum] The temple was dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and
Minerva, the great trinity of Etruscan deitieS, whose statues in terra-cotta
occupied the three chambers of the cella. Its dae’es natalis was observed
on the Ides (13th) os September3 on this day took place also the epulum

Iovis, the sacred feast held in honour of the three deitieS, and graced by ’

the presence of their statues. The original building, which was dedicated
(according to tradition) in the first year of the Republic, lasted till
83 B.c., when it was burnt to the ground : the second building (which
Livy saw) was raised on the same plan. Detailed measurements indicate
that the early Italic foot, not the later Roman, was the unit, and that
the cella was ιοο feet square ε ἱιι front were three rows os six columns
each, and on either side a single tow, the whole forming a larger
square.

ln monte Tarpeio] According to Dionysius (XI. 8) this was the
earlier name of the Capitoline hill. subsequently the epithet Tarpeius
was usually applied to the S.W. side: but see note on c. 1 1. 6.

8 metaumaucensis] These clauses are dependent on the idea
contained in monumentum. The vow of the elder Tarquin is mentioned
in 38. 7.

9 fi 2. a. ostem religionibus] ‘all other claims of religion? ubera]
has practically the force of liberata, ‘ssfreed ‘streleased

ιο tota] perhaps to be taken adverbially with esset, ‘entirely’ . cf.
Hor. Sat. 1. 9. ἰ nescio quid meditans nugarum, et totus in illis.

mutatam] ‘withdraw from dedication,' opposed to inaugurata
below. inauguratio means the dedication by augurs of places (templa)
to be used sor the taking of auspices, or sor meetings held, or actions
done, auspicato. consecratio means the dedication of sites or buildings
(e.g. fana, sacella), whether templa or not, sor religious uses. See note
on c. 18. 9 templo.

1 ι sacella] ‘shrineS,’ i.e. small unroofed places containing an altar
sacred to some deity.

a. Τ. Tatio] This name gives the clue for an explanation of the
arascguraub. The Sabine, i.e. the Patrician, cults on the Capitol were
dispossessed, at least in part, to make room for Tarquin’s (i.e. the
Etruscan, anti-Patrician) reformation.

ια in ipso flaminino] ‘just at the crisis)
