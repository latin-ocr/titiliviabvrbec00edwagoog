quidem magmficentiae operum. The reading magmficentia (ablative) of
“ the Medicean MS. has been adopted, as the simplest expedient, though
it leaves the sentence almost as clumsy as before.

The opera which Livy has in his mind are the public buildings at
Rome which he had seen begun or completed before the date of this
book (i.e, about 27 B.C.). Such were the Basilica Aemilia (54- 46 B.C.)‚
which eost about ζ5οο,οοο; the Forum Iulium (54—46 Rc, ), which
cost about Assoomoo 3 the Forum Augustum (43-2 Β.(;·.); the Imperial
Palace, including the Domus Augus-tana aud the Temple of Apollo, in
building from 28 B.c. onwards ι and the Mausoleum, built in 27 B.C.

CHAPTER LVI.

5 ς 1.. undique ex Etruria] ‘ from every part of Etruria’: the second
expression limits the first.

6 poema...pubuea] Presumably a part of the tributum, to which
since the institution of the census by Servius each citizen contributed
according to his income.

7 operiamex plebe] ‘ labourers drawn from the populace' ε ex plebe
answers publica. For the whole statement cf. Cic. Verr- v. 48
Capitolium... publice coactis fabris operitque imperatis gratis exaedffican‘
potuit. Tarquin's use of forced labour recalls the σοι-νέες of ancient

gravabatur above) implies a common occurrence.

soron...faolemdoe] See 35. 8, where the introduction of these ‘rows ’
is assigned to the older Tarquin. The gerund and gerundive are
occasionally used thus in apposition: cf. 14„ 7, and 11. 47. ια neque
immemor eius, quod initio consulatus imbiberat, reconciliandi animos
plebis. [W.-M.]

12 eloacam maximam] ‘main drain.’ The extant remains of this
(which date in all probability from the third century B.C., with altera·
tions and restorations made in Imperial times) show that it ran from the
E. end of the Subura in a W. S. W. direction across the Forum, under
the Vicus Tuscus and Velabrum, and so into the Tiber. There is no
reason to doubt that the original structure belonged to the Regal period:
and the existence of similar structures in Etruria, dating from that era,
shows that it may well have been made under Etruscan influence. Its
