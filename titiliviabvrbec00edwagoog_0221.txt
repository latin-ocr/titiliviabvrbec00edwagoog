32 cum insomnis agunt] ‘ urge each trio' ι the oratio obliqua follow,
giving the argument.

P· 31. 1 ἓ 2. ibt] ‘on that side.' ruent] pf. subj., rendering fut. pf-
of oratio recta, and implying that the victory must precede the sovereignty.
Cf. 48. 2 apparebatque regnatumm qui vicisset.

3 9 8. dimicarent] QQQQQ (like the op-

tative aster πρὶν in Greek) properly denotes that an action is not only
preceded—AQQQ <cf· 14· 1 1 obi·

cerentur); but here and elsewhere in Livy (cf.26. 1 digrederentur)
scarcely any intention seems to be implied, so that the subjunctive
becomes practically equivalent to the indicative—a familiar tendency in
Silver Latin.

4 culus] Most MSS. read cuiusque, which must then be regarded as
equivalent to cuiuscumque: except in Plautus, quisque is exceedingly
rare in this sense. ¹

5 cum bona. paco] ‘in peace and quiet ⁹—a common phrase in Livy.
For the formal epithet, cf. dolo malo below. '

6 foedera] The word is formed from the root fld-‚ and implies a basis ,
offides or ⁶ honour ’ between the parties τ this ‘ honour ' is confirmed by
formal actions, which are obviously earlier than the formal words which
prescribe them. Livy considers that the conditions of treaties differ
according to circumstanceS‚ but that the formalities of treaty-making
have been the same from time immemoria13 he therefore applieS‚ by
a pardonable anachronism, the conventional terms of historical times to
a prehistoric occasion.

9 §4- fetialis] (most probably connected with fari, so, like orator, =)
⁶ speaker,' ‘ spokesman,' ⁴ herald,’ ‘ commissioner.’ The college of
fitiales were guardians of the public saith: their duties are summed up
in a law quoted by Cicero (de Legg. 11. 9. 21) foederum,- pacis, belli,
indutiarum oratores fetiales iudicesque sunto: bella disceptante. Their·
official acts in connection with the declaration of war are described in
c. 32. 5—14 belova See Wordsworth‚ Fragments and Specimens of
Early Latin, p. 551 and soll.

το patre patrato] ‘executor in chief,’ ‘king's commissioner.' It was
usual for two or three filiales to be sent on a mission such as this : they
chose one to act as their chief (see ἕ 6 below). patratus may be (1) passive
(so Wordsworth)‚ ‘ made father,' i.e. deputed to act paternally for the
king, and so ‘deputy chief ἐ or (2) deponent (so Weissenborn,
who compares cenatus, iuratus), =‘ that hath ratified‚’ so ‘ plenipo-
tentiary.'
