League. Nor is this surprising‚ for in his elemental character-
istics he is a Ianus, with none of the attributes of the Iuppiter
Capitolinus who is to take his place as the sovereign deity of
imperial, more than Latin, Rome. Diana is then the feminine
expression, Iuppiter Latiaris· the masculine, of Latin devotion:
and it was essential, in the movement of Rome towards the
primacy of Latium, that both deities should be ritually propitiated.
This is why Servius Tullius was said to have built for Diana a
temple in Rome: but it is to be remembered that it stood on the
Aventine, tle. outside the pomerium, though within the Servian
wall, as beseemed a worship not representing the city-state but
associated with an outside league².

But whether Servius Tullius rex at Rome is, or is not, the
counterpart of servus rex at Aricia, he is the patron of the
Latin element in the state, the Father of the Plebs, And the

¹ More than this may be implied in the connection of Servius Tullius
with the cult of the Arician Diana. Mated there with the goddess was
the masculine spirit Virbius, himself perhaps a local conception of him
whom elsewhere we know as Janus. Aud the priest of Diam at Aricia
was an escaped slave, who went about always armed, for whoever killed
him succeeded to his office and his title, rex nemoeenszk. He was thus
a servus rex, regarded as the ritual embodiment of Virbius: and the
clivus Virbius at Aricia was ever the resort of slaves and beggam.
Diana of Aricia was worshipped on the Ides of August: and at a similar
August festival of slaves in Rome the dedication of the Aventine temple
of Diana by Servius Tullius was commemorated· The servus rex at
Aricia had often to flee from his would-be successor: and in old age he,
the mortal representative of Virbius, would often be caught and slain. ,
So, according to the legend, Servius Tullius tried to flee in Rome, and
was slain by the servants of his would-be successor on the clivus Vrbius
(Virbius) : hard by was a shrine of Diana, among the Oak-groves of the
Esquiline, where he himself had lived. This flight of the king (perhaps
originally a race for an annual kingship, and then a test of fitness
to be king), was ceremonially continued in the chq‘fu32‘um, wherein
the rex sacrorum fled from the Forum the moment a sacrifice had been
offered in the Comitium.
