¹9· quemcumque] It was customary in Roman prayer to avoid all ‘.
possible offence by giving a deity all his titles (e. g. Matutine pater, seu
Iane libentius audis), and adding even then some such phrase as aut
quocumque alio nomine rite vocaris: the same idea seems to be present
in Aesch. Ag. 160 Ζεύς, ὅστις ποτ’ ἐστίν, εἰ τόδ’ αὐτῷ φίλον κεκλημένῳ.
Here Livy follows the custom, giving Aeneas the benefit of the generali-
sation. moreover Paulum, p. 106, sayS, Indigetes di, quorum nomena--
vulgari non licet.

20 super Numicum] ‘beyond the N.,' i. e. on the fin-ther side from
Rome, on which Lavinium was situated. According to one tradition,
Aeneas fell into the Numicus (Numicius) in his ssight from MezentiuS,
and Ascanius slew the latter in revenge.

21 Iovem Indigetem] The word Indages means ‘local ' in abode or
activity, ἐπιχώριος, χθόνιος = so Dionysius (1. 64) says that the inscription
in this case ran πατρὸς θεοῦ χθονίου. As Iuppiter Indzjges, Pater Indiges,
or Deus Indiges (and afterwards Aeneas Indtges also), Aeneas became
closely connected with the ancient sanctuary of Latin unity, the home of
the Penates at Lavinium.

CHAPTER III. ,

5 1. imperio] For the dat. , expressing remote object, cs. 11. 5. 3
seges matura messi ; Hor. Od. Ι. 2 3. 12 tempestiva viro.
25 tanta...orat] explains muliebri, and gives a reason for the whole
sentence: cf. Praef. 1 1 adeo.
26 puero stetit] ‘ was assured to the lad ἐ so Virg. Aen. 1. 268 dum res
stetit Ilia regno.
Θ 5 8. quis...pro certo adfirmet Ρ] Hmothetical subjunctive, Q·
tasis being understood. The same phrase occurs again in xxvn. ι. 13:
it expresses the attitude adopted by Livy in the Preface (5 6).
29 comos indo] For the order cf. 6. 1 caedem deinceps tyranni.
30 Iulum] cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 267—8 at puer Ascanius, cui nunc cognomen
Iulo additur—Ilus erat, dum res stetit Ilia regno. Iulus probably means ³
‘ little Jupiter ' 3 and the traditional connection of the Julii with Iulus is
supported by their family worship of Veiovis (the little Jupiter). Be·
tween Iulus and Silvius (see 5 6) there was, according to one tradition,
a division of prerogativeS, Iulus being invested‘ with the chief priesthood.
(Cf. Frater, Early History qf the Kingship, p. τοο.)
eundem] A certain antithesis lies hidden here: ‘whom as Iulus,
though one and the same.’ Cf. Aurelius Victor, -Ονιζξ, Gent. Rom. 1v. 7
hunc Faunum plerique eundem Silvanum a silvis esse dzbcmnt.
