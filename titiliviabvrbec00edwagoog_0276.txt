3¹ 5 12. necmnon convenire] The other locus classicus alluding, but
with no greater certainty than Livy, to this reform of the comitia
centur-hta, is Dionysius, ιν. 21: ἐν δὲ τοῖς καθ’ ἡμᾶς κεκίνηται χρόνοις,
καὶ μεταβέβληκεν εἰς τὸ δημοτικώτερον, ἀνάγκαις τισὶ βιασθεὶς ἰσχυραῖς, οὐ
τῶν λόχων (centuries) καταλυθέντων, ἀλλὰ τῆς κλήσεως (classifioetion)
αὐτῶν οὐκέτι τὴν ἀρχαίαν ἀκρίβειαν φυλαττούσης, ὡς ἔγνων ταῖς ἀρχαιρε-
σίαις αὐτῶν πολλάκις παρών.

It is not told by any ancient authority when this change of the
Servian comitia took place, nor what was the exact arrangement
adopted. It may well have been connected with the completion of
the 35 tribes (in B.c. 241), and it was clearly based upon a co-ordination
of tribes and centuries. Pantagathus, in the 16th century, proposed a
solution of the problem which has been confirmed by inscriptions and
generally accepted.

According to this view, each os the 35 tribes contained a century of
seniores and of iuniores in each of the 5 classes, i. e. ιο centuries, making
a total of 350 centuries, i. e. 70 centuries in each class. Itis not possible
to say with certainty what arrangement was adopted in regard to the
equites equo publico—whether they were included (as Livy xum. 16
[169 B.C.] includes them) with the pedites in the first class in each tribe
(as those citizens would be who had the equestrian pmperty-qualifioetion
but not the equus publicus) or remained distinct as 18 centuries. The
latter alternative, if we include in the reformed classification‚ as in
the Servian, 4 centul-ies of supernumeraries (fabri, accensi, liticines,
cornicines) and one os capite censi (= pmletan'i), gives the new total
as 350 4- 18 4- 5 -- 373 centuries: the former gives 355.

Livy’s phrase duplicato earum numero centuriis iuniorum seniorumque,
in reference to the classification existing in his own day (hunc ordinem,
qui nunc est), is difficult. earum most naturally refers to tribus: and
the sense is ‘ their number being doubled (i.e. reckoned twice over, as 70
instead of 35) by-in respect of-the centuries of iuniores and seniores)
Or it is perhaps possible to take carum as referring to centuriae, and
centuriis as referring to the Servian classification z in this case the sense
is ‘the present classification...in view of their (the centuries') duplication
does not agree with the centuries of iuniores and seniores to make the
total instituted by Servius-⁹ The first of these renderings alludes to the
reform which co—ordinated tribes and centuriesz the second is merely
