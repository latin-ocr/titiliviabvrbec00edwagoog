The 'similarities between Livy and his Greek contemporary
Dionysius of Halicarnassus are remarkable,·in regard both to
form and to subject-matter: an'd as it cannot be proved that
either used the work of the other, we are led to conclude that
both had access to the same sources of information—-perhaps in
the same libraries at Rome. The verbal agreements between
them are especially frequent in the chronicle of the last two
kings: in fact, the relationship—the synopsis—may be said to
begin with the reign os Servius Tullius : but even here they do
not use the same authorities, or not in the same way. It would
seem that DionysiuS, for all his sulneSS‚ omits points (eg. state
for-malities) that might not be intelligible or interesting to Greek
readers while the Roman omits rather what might interfere
' with· the general unity of his subject.

Livy himself tells us in his Preface that the effort of successive
historians has -been twofold, either to bring more certain infor-
mation or to improve upon the style of their predecessors: and
he has left the impress of his own personality upon the style
rather than upon the science of history. And indeed, the influence
of rhetoric on the writing of Roman history is beyond disputez
Cicero⁸ calls history-writing opus unum oratorium maxime, and·
Quintilian⁴ holds the same view. Roman criticism, on the other
hand, had no experience, no rules: and thus it was not sur· .

accuracy‚ in the mind of a historian. In fact, at the time when
Livy wrote, the educated Roman was swayed by two dominant
influences-——patriotism and rhetoric. Livy felt both, and followed
both, to the utmost os his capacity: and doubtle'ss h'e found
therein the justification of his task. So history wi'th him was
