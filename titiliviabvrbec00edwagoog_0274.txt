remainder represented a re·organization (sex...centurias...fecit) of an
existing establishment.

5 0. aliu] ‘separate.’

nex...oenturlu] These consisted of Patricians (Cicero, Or. 156. calls
them centuriae procum patricium), and came to be known as the sex
centuriae (cf. 36. 8), or the sex sufflagia, perhaps because their votes
were taken first separately from those of the other η centuries, in the
earliest meetings of the comitia for political purposes.

The total establishment of 1800 knights may have belonged to the
pre-Servian epoch. (See c. 36. 7 above.) Cicero (de Rep. 11. 20. 36)
says of L. Tarquinius, equitatum ad hunc morem constituit qui usque
adhuc est retentus, nec potuit Titiensium et Ramneusium et Lucerum
mutare cum cuperet nomina...sed tamen prioribus equitum partibus
secundis additis MDCCC fecit equites numerumque duplicavit. But
here as in c. 36. 7 M ac CC may be the right reading. In any ease the
effect of the Servian organization was to rearrange the cavalry into 18
centurieS‚ and to reserve six, with the old names doubled‚ to the
patricians. It seems scarcely possible, in view of the previous in·
creases mentioned by Livy, that Servius Tullius doubled the establishment
to a total os 3600 equites.

, tribus ab Romulo mamantis] See c. 13. 8.

quibus inauguratae erant] ‘ which they had received inaugurally ’
(under augural sanction), and so unalterably: cs. 36. 3 id...inaugurato
Romulus ficerat.

dena mma aeris ex publico data] i-e. aes equestre. Is the valuation
of the as given above (ς ι) be correct, we are to suppose that each eques
received a sum equivalent to 2000 libral asses ( = 20 oxen) from the
state-chest (publicum) for the purchase of a horse—or of two horseS, for
himself and his squire (Paulu3‚ p. 22 1). It does not appear whether the
allowance was renewed as occasion required, or made once for all ; if
two horses cost 2000 libral asses, the sum here agrees with Varro's state-
ment (L. L. vul. 71), equum publicum mille assarium esse. The
equites proper were said equo publico merere, as distinguished from
equites equo privato, who provided horse and forage at their own
expense.

qulbus. ..alerenfl This clause is final, depending on bina milia.

viduae attributae] i.e. ⁶ unmarried women,’ whether widows or
not, whose property was rateable. Cicero (de Rep. 11. 36) says orbomm
(i.e. orphans, or perhaps childless men as well) et ve'cluarum tributis in
this connection. attributae either means ‘ were laid under contribution,'
