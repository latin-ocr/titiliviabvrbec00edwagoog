160 LIVY. I [xxxn §8

15 mm...mutat1⁸] ‘ with a few verbal changes in the form (strain)
and style (setting) of the oath,' i.e. to suit the different cases, For
carminis see n. on 24. 6. This formality os secking satisfaction (quo
res repetuntur), i.e. of declaring war, was known as clarigatio, perhaps
from the lond cry of the pater patratus.

16 peu-agit] Cf. 18. ro.

17 5 0. mnemon] ‘ customary‚’ ‘ conventional ¹: in 22. 5 the thirtieth
day is mentioned.

19 ξ 10. Iane 011111110] an emendation for Iuno Quirine. Quirine =
Ianus as guardian of the completed state (cf. Fowler‚ R. F„ p. 290), or
⁸ Sabine ' (from Cures), or ‘ of the oak' (from quercus). See notes on
15. 6 above. In any case the appeal to Juppiter and Janus—probably
duplicate deities—and to all the di caelestes, terrestres, inferni, is in
accordance with the practice of archaic worship, which feared to omit
any epithet or agency that might lend assistance.

21 11111ιεῒ11111]ι against rightss of thought. neque...pors01vero]of deed.

22 maiores natu] ‘'elders —i.e. the Senate (γερουσία), who formed the
King’s council.

2 5 g u. quarum rerum litium eausa-rum] ‘as concerning the object3‚
clainm, and considerationS, whereof.’ These genitives are a difficulty.
(1) We may suppose that they express the sphere of action contemplated
in the formula, and affected by the formal term condixit (i-e. condictionem
ficit or dixit=denunt221v22¹) ‘has given notice-³ Such a genitive is not
unfamiliar in legal formS‚ and is found occasionally in connection with
the legis actiones (cf. Gaius, lv. 21) of which condictio became one. In
this case rerum l. c. are attracted into the case of the relative, like in
quem primo egressi sunt locum Troia vocatur, in c. 1. 3 above. Or (2) the
genitives may depend on quid censes? (like our ‘ what think you of... ?');
in which case the relative is attracted from accusative (i.e. earum
rerum...quas governed by condixit) into the case of its nouus, after the
Greek fashion. Cf. 29. 4, 40. 5.

26 pater patratus] See 11.οῃ 24. 4.

110111111...αιι11-11111111] See 11. 011 24. 5.
