Religious development and the expansion of the city and the
constitution were closely connected. We have explained above
that the city of the Four Regions roughly corresponds to the
traditions concerning the middle period of the kingship. There
may have been further settlements before and during the age
which we call that of Servius Tullius; and it is at any rate clear
(see the map of Rome) that the area included by the wall
ascribed to him was larger on the north-east and the south
than that of the Four Regions. But the pomerium was not
correspondingly extended: and therefore the Aventine, though
within the civil boundary, was without the ritual boundary‚ the
templum proper, and so remained until the days of Claudius
Caesar. This is in itself a significant indication of the fact that the
city-state had outgrown, in compass as in constitution, the ritual
restrictions of an earlier date. No doubt the line of the Servian
wall was in great measure determined by the requirements of
defence: the slopes of the Quirinal and the Esquiline, the
height of the Aventine, though not as yet required for
dwelling5‚ might, if unfortified, offer an attacking force just the
poae‘nts d'appui it needed. Theresore, on the side of easiest
approach, the east, where nature offered little assistance, the
fortifications took the form of an agger—ditdi, and mound, and
wall above the mound. Authorities are disagreed as to whether
the portions os ‘Servian’ wall and agger still standing are really
those of the regal period: the most recent investigationS, how-
ever, seem to show a lower and a higher section, and it is at

least conceivable that the lower belongs to the sixth century .

, Within the wall the Four Regions were recognised and per-
petuated by the redistribution of the inhabitants in four local
tribes, These may well have been the city-'s share in a total of
some twenty tribes or districts, embracing the territory at this
time under Roman control, for Livy (in 11. 21) mentions a new
tribe, as bringing the total to twenty-one. Livy supposes (c. 43. 13)
that these local tribes in Rome were connected-with the war-tax
