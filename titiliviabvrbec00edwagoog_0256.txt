168 LIVY. I [xxxv ἓ 7

η iuuet] probably vowed (votivi) during the war to Jupiter, and

therefore magni (see ἕ ιο).

epulonum inan-uotiuum] ‘with greater magnificence and elabora-
tion’ :this also is an instance of Tarquin' s ambitio. The expression
does not imply that these games had been celebrated before, but that
Tarquin, in introducing them, improved upon the games instituted by
previous king& e.g. the Consualia of Romulus (9. 6 above). ,

13 5 Β. ωηο] It was situated immediately between the Palatine and
the Aventine. For the dative see n. on 5. 6 Numitori.

14 demtus] ‘traced,’ ‘ marked out': cf. ιο. 5. looe] ‘sites.’

patribus equum-que] Livy anticipates the distinction of ordines
which existed in the later Republic. According to Suetonius (Claud. αι)
the allotment of special scats in the circus properly belongs to
Augustus.

1 5 memma] ‘ssplaces ‘seatsss facerentJ' i. e. by means of the wooden
structures described below.

rori] ‘‚’benches ‘’rows of seats: cf. 56. τ, where the younger
Tarquin employs forced labour for making fori.

16 ἓ 0. spectavere.. φθάσει] ‘their view was obtained by the use of
piers supporting seats twelve seet up above the ground-line.’ The
distributive numeral duodenos implies that each block was constructed
on the same general plan.

17 equi] Horsemanship—chariot·driving and riding—was always a
characteristic feature of the Ludi Romani.

ex Etruria] Tarquin was able to introduce Etruscan performers in
virtue of his connection with that country, as a means of amusing his
new subjects—-another instance of his ambitio.

18 ξ 10. souemnm, deinde annui] ‘ periodical (lit. customary), subse-
quently annual ⁹: perhaps they developed out of a festival celebrated
each year when the army returned from its summer manoeuvreS, whether
these had included active service or not.

19 Romam magnique] The first epithet insists on the national
character, the second on the religious priority of the festival, as
dedicated to Jupiter. Although Livy gives the two epithets as inter·
changeable, it is probable that magni should really be applied to any
games performed in fulfilment of a vow to Jupiter, Romani to these
particular games when they became regular (annu2): but there was a
certain similarity in the programme. Eventually the Ludi Romani

extended over many days (4—19 September), and included an im·
portant sacrificial banquet, the epulum Iovis.
