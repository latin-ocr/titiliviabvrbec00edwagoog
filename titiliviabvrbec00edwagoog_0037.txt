topographical and on ritual groundS, that the first development
was rather in an eastward and north-eastward direction⁹ over
the slopes of the Esquiline and Caelian. The three parts of
the Palatine (Palatium, C ermaluS, Velia), with three spurs of the
Esquiline (Oppius, Cispius, Fagutal), and one of the Caelian
(Sucusa), make a total of seven: and in the festival of the
Septimontium, celebrated by the seven groups of settlerS, we
may see the ritual expression of this expansion, just as in the
Lupercalia we found the ritual expression of the oldest settle-
ment. Varro¹ describes the Septimontium as feriae non populi
sed montanorum modo. That is to say, the festival implies
some sort of religious association, but not a political fusion.
The prehistoric struggle for the October horse²‚ between the
Palatine-men and the rest, seems to belong to this same period.

Then, as we may suppose, the Sabines established them·
selves on the Quirinal hill, and extended their boundaries
gradually to include more and more os the mons Capitolium,
with which in ancient days the Quirinal was connected by a
ridge³. So the northern summit of the Capitoline became their
citadel ς and the col (called inter duos lucos) between it and the
southern summit was the traditional situation of the asylum
where according to one story Romulus harboured runawayS.
The southern peak—the Capitolium proper of later days—was
precipitous on one side, where was the famous saxum Tarpeium ;
and there were even those who supposed that the whole hill
was once called mons Tarpeius. The story of the maid Tarpeia
has been variously related and interpreted: Livy's account⁴
makes her an example of treachery, but Propertius⁵ veils the
treachery in her love for Titus TatiuS, and Calpurnius Piso,
followed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus⁶‚ thought that she
pretended treachery to save her country. The fact remains
that her sepulchre was erected and her memory honoured by
the Romans: and this seems to indicate that she was rather
