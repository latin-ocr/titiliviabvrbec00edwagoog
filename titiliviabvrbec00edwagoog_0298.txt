might be read, to give the necessary ambiguity: to a Gabine Sextus would
then seem to say that he was plenipotentiary ‘in the interests of Gabii:
to Tarquin that he had the complete control, while the messenger
(dubiae fidei videbatur) would not have his suspicions aroused.

18 ξ 0. mmma papa-vorum comta] Herodotus' account (v. 9²) of
the conduct of ThtasybuluS, tyrant of Miletus, when Periander of Corinth
had sent a messenger to ask what policy was safest‚ is so much like what
is here related, that it may well have been borrowed by Greek or
Roman writers for the present purpose. See note on 53. 5 supra.

19 g ¹7. interrogando...reeponnum] For the use of the abl. of the
gerund see n. on 5. 6. The gerund·construction exspectando responsum,
not infrequent in Livy in similar caseS, here serves to avoid assonmce,
and to keep the two ideas (interrogando, exspectando responsum) apart-

ἰο ut re imperfecta] ut gives the personal feeling of the messengerz the

Greek equivalent would be ὡς ἄπρακτος ἄν. Cf. 34. 7 facile paneada
ut cupido honorum.

Μ eum] i.e. Tarquin.

24 5 8. ambagibus] ‘enigmas’z the word occurs again in 5 5. 6, 56. 9.

25 sua. ipsos invidia opportunos] ‘through the chauces afforded by
personal unpopularity.’ Cf. vl. ²4· 3 Romanus cedentem hostem effuse
sequendo opportunus kuic eruptioni fuit. For the position and force of
apsos see n. on 1 1. 9 sua ipsam peremptam mercede.

26 multi palam...1nterfeot1] This sentence amplifies its predecessor.

27 in quihus] ‘in whose case) futura] ‘likely to be,’ ‘sure to be': the
participle expresses the possibility as viewed by Tarquin-

28 §⁹- patuit] ‘ was allowed ’ς besides these voluntary exiles were
those who had no choice (acti sunt). On the question of exile see
n. on 41. 7.

‚30 divim fuere] ‘stood sor distribution.' This predicative dative, in
which the action is directed towards a point, resembles the 'dative of
‘work contemplated ’ elsewhere noticed. Other verbal nouns so used
by Livy are m‘sui, usui, sumptui: divisui erant occurs in xxxlu. 46. 8.

g ιο. largitiones] ‘grantS‚' from the point of view of Sextus:
praedae] ‘ spoils,’ from that os the recipients.

32 adimi] historic infinitive.

Gabina τοῦ] Cf. 6. 3 Albana re.

CHAPTER LV.

P· 70. 4 5 Ι.. foedae...renovav1t] It does not appear when this
treaty cum Tuscis was first made: perhaps it is implied in the family
