2 effluente-...ammam The first point gives the reason for the
second.

3 ex plebe] is practically an adjective ‘of the populace,’=plebeii ε cs.
¹7· 4 sinc imperio·

6 5 12. rasum] The real meaning of this word is still undecided.
We know that Talasse or Talassio was the regular Roman cry of saluta-
tion to a bride as she passed to the bridegroom’s house; and it is probable
that the word is an invocation of some old marriage-god, associated with
the primitive form of marriage by capture of which the ‘ Rape of the
Sabines ' is here made a type. The word Talus is an old Sabine name,
and the marriage-god Talassius or Talassio may have been of Sabine
origin. Another marriage-custom which survived from the days of wife·
capture was the parting of the bride's hair with the point of a spear
(called kasta caelibaris) to indicate that she was the prize of the spear
(cf. Gk. δορίληπτος).

raptam ferunt] ⁶ was being carried off, they say ’τ the or. obl.
reproduces rapiebatur.

, 8 indo] Note that Livy, by using oratio obliqua, leaves the responsibility

for this explanation with his informants.

10 ἓ 18. Μουσωῒοεῃλοοάιιε] either (1) ‘- denouncing a treaty where
hospitality had been outraged ’ ε gen. of quality, cf. 1x. 45. 18 miserunt
Romam oratores pacis petendae amicitiaequu or (2) ‘ accusing the treaty
of violated hospitality,' i.e. regarding the treaty as responsible for the
outrage. It is proposed by some commentators to read violatum for
violati, or scelus for foedus. ’

12 per tas ao fldem] (1) ‘ by religion and honour ' (which they expected
the Romans to observe): cf. Plaut. Most. 500 perfidem deceptus sum,

. ‘under promise of protection': or (2) per: παρά, ‘contrary to': cf.
perfidus, periurus, perdo.

raptas] For the position and case see n. on 5. 6 et Numitori. There
were 683 of the raptae, according to Dionysius (11. 3o); and-they were
paraded next day, and allotted by Romulus·

14 fi 1⁴. patrum] i.e. of the Sabine women.

15 in matrimomo] They would have the position of wives, not of con·
cubines‚ in spite os their parents’ refusal to accept conubium with Rome:
cf. Dion. H. 11. 30. 5 ὡς οὐκ ἐφ’ ὕβρει τῆς ἁρπαγῆς ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ ’γάμῳ
γενομένης. in matrimonio gives the legal position, the rest of the
sentence its characteristics. ,

¹7 liberum] gen. pL: the form occurs again in 39. 4. fore] emphatic,
‘ would live.’
