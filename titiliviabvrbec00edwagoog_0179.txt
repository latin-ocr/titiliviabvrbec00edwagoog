neruum] The name of the Roman Hercules may have come from
the Greek through the Etruscan Hercle, or it may have a native
origin, and have been afterwards connected by resemblance with
Ἡρακλῆι-ε in any case the character and attributes of Hercules are
distinct. He is to be identified with the deity otherwise known as
Dius Fidius and Semo Sancus; me dius fidius=me hercule. He is
then a lord of oathS‚ closely related to Jupiter3 and oaths were taken at
the ara maxima, the centre of the worship of Hercules and of the legends
which Livy here relates. He is further the Genius of the man, the male
principle z. so Romans swore by Hercules, Dius Fidius, or their Genius;
women by their Juno. -

This worship of a male deity dated from a remote age: one
indication of its antiquity is seen in the round aedes Herculis which was

near neighbour to the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium. A ritual
reconstruction‚ at some time or other, .may have introduced certain

Greek characteristicS, known to have existed, and alluded to here by
Livy (Graeco ritu): but much that was ancient, and probably native,
survived‚ e.g. the sacrificial meal, and the exclusion of women (as from
a festival of the male Genius). An especially remarkable feature in the
worship was the offer-ing of tithes paid to the ara maxima in cases of
victory or discovered treasure. This tithe-giving accompanied the cult

of Hercules in Italy, and may have begun in an offering of first-fruits at
harvest-time: but it is unique in Italian ritual.

The ara maxima and the Aventine were closely connected with the
myth of Hercules and Cacus, Here again we seem to have something
un-Italian in character and personageS‚ and yet familiar enough in the
East. It is possible that the tale may have come from Phoenicia through
Greek traders to Sicily or Cumae, and thence to the Tiber, and that the
cult indicates a foreign worship furnished with an Italian home and
name. In Cacus (connected with caecus) we may see a demon of dark—
ness and the underworld, overcome by the genius of life, truth, and
manhood—a type, as the Romans conceived it, os triumphs the Greek
mythologists regarded him as a wicked one (κακός), who opposed the
good chieftain (εὔυδρος), and was overcome by the hero of strength on
his way back from one of his labourS. Fowler, Rom. Fest„ pp. 138--
144‚ 193—197. See also Introduction, §5 4, 7.

Livy’s account should be compared with those of Virgil (Am. vul.
186—251), Propertius (lv. 9. 1—20), and Ovid (Faezsti, 1. 543-584).
