Who, then, are the A bomjgines mentioned at the beginning of
Livy's history? It has been argued, with great skill and no
mean probabilityl, that they are to be regarded as an autoch-
thonous race, identical with the Ligurians 3 that, partly with
Pelasgian assistance, they drove out or merged in themselves

. the Siculi, who at one time occupied Tibur, Antemnae, Ficulea,

Tellenae, Crustumerium, and Aricia3 and that the Pelasgian
allie5‚ in other words an offshoot of that race which we know
elsewhere as ‘Mycenaean,’ afterwards disappeared, or rather,
became absorbed in the more numerous AborigineS, with
whom they had probably an affinity of physique and language.
Pelasgian influence may well be responsible for the polygonal
masonry which is to be seen in walls and gateways both north
and south of the Tiber. It is argued, further, that the story of
Evander’s occupation of the Palatine is probably based on some
such Pelasgian migration, associating the Greek and Italian
peninsulas ; and that the legendary league between Aeneas,
LatinuS‚ and Evander, against Turnus and the Rutuli typifieS‚ as
has already been suggested, a union of native tribes and kindred
immigrants against such racial opponents as the Siculi, who
were in effect the advanced guard of the Umbro-Sabellian
migrations from the north.

The line of Latin kings seems to represent the existence of a
league of towns and communities in Latium, having Alba as its
political and religious centre, and Iuppiter Latiaris and Diana
as its patron deities. The gradual increase of the settlements on
the Palatine and the neighbouring hills tended to the formation
of a single city which should challenge and win the supremacy
of this league of Latium. But before this came to pasS‚ the
communities by the Tiber were destined to receive into their
midst a hostile element, apopulation that should dominate in all
