Lm § 3] NOTES 207

ei adversatus esset]=fut. perf. of oratio recta: the apodosis to the
condition is contained in periculi.

7 ᾖ δ’. iunioribus] So, according to the Servian classification at
Rome (se'e 43. 2 above), the iuniores were liable sor field-service. See
also 59. 12 below.

8 ad lucum Ferentinae] See n. on 50. 1.

nequentee] Cf. 50. 1.

1 2 ξ ο. manipulos] ‘bands,' ‘ companies': the word implies the smallest
tactical unit which had. a separate standard. In the later organization
of the Roman army, associated with Camillus, the manipulus consisted
of two centuriae, each under a centuriO, and thus represented a sort of
‘ double-company' (to use a modern military phrase), commanded by the

senior centurion. In the present passage Livy probably identifies
mampulus and centuria.

ut singulius 1. e. he took a Latin half company and combined it with
a Roman half· -company to make a new company. What had been two
(Latin and Roman) became one, what had been one (a whole company,
Latin or Roman) became two (i.e. a part of two companies).

CHAPTER LIII.

17 ς 1,. degeneratum ln aliis] ‘his degeneracy in other respects.’
This use of the perf. part. by itself to denote a state of things is very
rare. It seems to have been developed from such impersonal phrases as
nuntiatum est, auditum est, treated participially, and so substantivally
(e.g. xxvu. 37. 5 liberatas religione mentes turbavit rursus nuntiatum).
A few other instances occur in Livy (e. g. vn. 8. 5 diu non perlitatum
tenuerat dictatorem), and there is one well known in Virgil, Aen. v. 7
notumque florens quid femina possit. The Greek formatioris in which
the neuter article with perf. part. or perf. infin. passive produces a
substantive may have suggested the construction in Latin.

Θ 5 2. Volscis] dat. of indirect object. in] ‘which was to last for'3
the preposition in such cases usually contains some idea of intention, e.g.
1x. 37. 12 indutias in triginta annos impetraverunt. ducentos amplius]
See n. on 23. 3 haud plus quinque milia.

ἰο Suessam Pometiam] See n. on 4¹· 7.

21 ,ξ 8. quaaraginta talenta menn] If the talent here be taken as
a sum equivalent to about ,ξατο (the value of the Euboic talent), this
means about Assem if the calculation be made according to weight, the
result is about A} 8100. The word talenta here suggests that Livy is
using an authority who wrote in Greek, probably Fabius Pictor.
