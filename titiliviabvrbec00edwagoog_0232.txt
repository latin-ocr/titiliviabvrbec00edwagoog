152 LIVY. I [xxv11159

20 rom] may be translated either ‘ state ’ (= res publica) or ‘ fortune,’
‘cause'e for the former cf. 6. 3 Albana re, 54. 10 Gabina re3 for the
latter 54. 3 quibus plerumque Gabina res superior esset. In such cases
res with an adjective corresponds exactly to the Greek use of a neuter
adjective with the definite article.

ancipitem] with animum, ‘ distracted.’

α g ιο. admotis quma-icis...earum] This use of an ablative ab·
solute connected by a demonstrative to another participial clause is an
irregularity of style, but it serves to make clear the successive stages os
an action, or to avoid an involved expression. There are many instances
of it in Livy, e.g. 43. 12 post evictas quinque et triginta tribus, duplzkato
earum numero.

υ ln diversum tter] ‘in opposite directions) So Virgil, Aen. vnr.
642 haud procul inde citae Melum in diversa quadrigae distulerant.

²3 lacerum...oorpu⁸] ‘ fragments of flesh.’

26 5 u. snppnoinm] The word seems to suggest that originally the
capital punishment of an offender was regarded in the light of a sacrifice
of expiation to the deity offended by his act. exempli] ‘type,’ ‘pattern.'

27 in ama] ‘in other cases’: placuisse] ‘were approved.’ The gradual
loss of power by the Comitia Centuriata (which, as a hals-military body,
could inflict capital punishment), and the gradual acquisition of power
by the Comitia T ributa (which could only impose a fine), indicates a
tendency towards leniency in Roman judicial punishments: cf. Cic. pro
Rabirio perduellionis reo, 10, vestram libertatem non acerbitate supplici-
orum infestam, sed lenitate legum munitam esse voluerunt. The
absence of the death-penalty in the Quaestiones Perpetuae was an
important factor in the revolutionary struggles of the dying Republie
(cf. Maine, Anc- Law, pp. 388—90). From exile, again, the early
Romans shrank with horror: as a punishment it was practically
unknown for centurie5‚ and eventually came to be regarded only
as a means of escaping worse penaltieS. On the other hand, Roman
military punishmentS, of which this may be regarded as an instance,
were cruel enough, e. g. fustuarium, decimatio.

CHAPTER XXIX.

p. 39. 3 5 2. omn-ia...miscet·] ‘ spreads general confusion)
4 5 8. tacita macentia] ⁶ subdued sadness': tacita has a notion of
‘ unprotesting ' about it, and this phrase refers rather to personS,
silentium triste to thingS.
