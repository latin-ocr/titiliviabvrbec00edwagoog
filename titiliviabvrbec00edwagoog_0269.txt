xmu] NOTES 181

the end of the regal period, these pieces were stamped (aes signatum)
with figures of animals (nota pecudum, pecore notatum), and hence
known as pecunia. The use of aes signatum seems to have given place
to a definite currency of bronze weights (aes grave), with the as of
12 ounces as unit, in the fifth century, between 452 and 430 B.c., and
this innovation is by some authorities attributed to the Decemvirs,
The coinage of asses librales (i.e. of weight equal to their value) was
introduced considerably later, perhaps not tin 338 B.c.

Now we know by a Lex Tarpeia of 45¹ B.c. that an ox was then
reckoned as equivalent to 100 asses ε and if we apply this standard by
way of experiment to the Servian classification as recorded by Livy, we
get 1000 cows (= 100,000 asses) as the minimum of property required
for the first class-or 1200 cows, if Pliny's figure of 120,000 asses
is correct. This is surely far too high a standard of wealth for the
regal period ι and most scholars are accordingly of opinion that the
ratings given by Livy cannot refer to asses librales, but must represent
some depreciation.

It is recorded that in the course of the F irst Punic War (264-241
Rc.) the coined as which had already been depreciated in weight from
12 (or, as most specimens sh0vv, 10) to 4 ouuces, was reduced to
a ounceS, or ᾗ (sextans) os a pound, and in the Second Punic War to
one uncta. That is to say, the original or libral as was equivalent to
5 or 6 asses sextantarii, and to 10 or 12 asses unciarii. There had been
also a certain reduction in the weight and value of the silver denarius,
or 10-as picce, until by ‘²41 nc. or thereabout it was practically equiva-
lent to the Attic drachma.

Dionysius assigns 100 minae, or 10,000 drachmae, to the first Servian
class, and this (as 10,000 drachmae=10,000 denan'i) is equivalent to
100,000 asses of ²41 13.C. If then Livy is expressing the original quali·
fications in terms of the currency of 241 13.c.‚ we ought to divide his
totals by 6 (or 5). This gives us roughly 16‚600-1 2,500—-8, 300—4,150
(or, dividing by 5, 20,000—-15‚000-—10‚000-—5,000) sor the first four
classes3 or, in terms of oxen, 160, 120, 80, 40 (or, 200, 150, 100, 50).
These figures do not appear unreasonable sor the regal period.

On the other hand, 100,000 asses sextantarii is held to be too low a

figure for the first class in the comitia centuriata as reformed about 241 ·

B.0. 400,000 sestertii (i.e. 1‚000,000 asses) became after this time the
standard of qualification for the equites, and therefore presumably
of the first class. Now 100,000 asses librales would yield just about
1,000,000 asses una'arii, and therefore we may be justified in considering
