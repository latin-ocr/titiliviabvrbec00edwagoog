160 LJVY. J [xxxa ξε

15 paucis...mutatia] ‘ with a few verbal changes in the form (strain)
and style (setting) os the oath,' i.e. to suit the different caseS. For
carminis see n. on 24. 6. This formality of seeking satisfaction (quo
rcs repetuntur), i.e. of declaring war, was known as clarigatio, perhaps
from the loud cry of the pater patratus.

16 pangit] Cf. 18. ιο.

17 ἓ 0. anemos] ‘ customary‚' ‘ conventional ’z in 22. 5 the thirtieth
day is mentioned.

19 ἓ 10. Iano Quirine] an emendation for Iuno Quirine. Quirine =
Ianus as guardian of the completed state (cf. Fowler, R. F„ p. 290), or
‘ Sabine ² (from Cures), or ‘ of the oak ' (from quercus). see notes on
15. 6 above. In any case the appeal to Juppiter and Janus—probably
duplicate deities—and to all the di caelestes, terrestres, inferni, is in
accordance with the practice of archaic worship, which faered to omit
any epithet or agency that might lend assistance. .

21 iniustum] ‘ against right,' of thought. nequo...perso1vere] of deed.

22 maiores natu] ‘ elders '—i.e. the Senate (γερουσία), who formed the
King's council.

25 5 11. quarum rerum litium causarum] ‘as concerning the objectS,
claimS, and considerations, whercof.’ These genitives are a difficulty.
(1) We may suppose that they express the sphere of action contemplated
in the formula, and affected by the formal term condixit (i.e. condictionem
fecit or dixit :denuntiavffl ‘ has given notice.’ Such a genitive is not
unfamiliar in legal formS, and is found occasionally in connection with
the legit actiones (cf. Gaius, ιν. 21) of which condictio became one. In
this case rerum l. c. are attracted into the case of the relative, like in
quem primo egressi sunt locum Troia vocatur, in c. 1. 3 above. Or (2) the
genitives may depend on quid censes? (like our ‘ what think you of... ?');
in which case the relative is attracted from accusative (i.e. aarum
rerum...quas governed by condixit) into the case of its nounS, after the
Greek fashion. Cf. 29. 4, 40. 5.

26 pater patratus] See n. on 24. 4.

popun...Qu111t1um] See n. on 24. 5.

27 Priscorum Latinorum] See n. on 3. 7. Hitherto the formulae
have been left open: now a particular people is inserted, with reference
to the war which immediately follows in the next chapter.

dederunt. . solverunt. . .feoorunt] ‘ rendered.. .fulfilled. . ,discharged ’ ς
the three words recall the three specifications res, liter, causas, which are
here expressed in res alone.

31 ἓ 12. puro pioque duello] ‘by a war of justice and duty? Cf. Cic.
