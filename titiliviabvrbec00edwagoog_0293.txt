LI ξ 7] NOTES 205

os the principal verb, is sometimes used (as here) with the sense of an
aorist: cf. xxlv. 7. 1 1 Romam veniens comitia edixit.

αι 52. pro imperio] ‘in virtue of his authority’: cf. 111. 49. 5 iam
pro imperio Valerius discedere a privato lictores iubebat. The ius vitae
necisque, implied in the imperium of Tarquin‚ could not be exercised
beyond the pomerium of Rome.

24 vim masnamJ‘ a large quantity? as in 37. 1 above

2 5 sineret] a mild form of Jussive‚ introduced by the general sense of
the previous clause. So in lv. 45. 4 Tusculanis negotium datum, adver-
terent animos ne quid novi tumultus Lavicis oriretur.

27 5 8. re nova] ‘ strange occurrence ’z cf. 60. 1 re nova trepzklus.
The plural, res novae (cf. 52. 1 novantem res), denotes change and
connotes revolution, like νεωτερισμόςε the singular is but rarely found
in this sense, which rs not intended here.

30 5 4.d101]‘he was told, he said’ ——an or. ebl. within an or. obl-2 so
again in 5 6. · ·

31 teneat] For the subjunctives 1n this or. obl. see n. on 1. 8 audierit.

3² adgressurum fuisse] ‘meant to have made his attack' 5 adgressus
esset in direct narration.

P. 66. 1 auctor eonem-i] ‘the convene-r of-the person responsible for—
the counciL’

3 5 ὀ. morando] ‘by the delay’ (caused by Tarquin), not ‘by
delaying.' Livy thus extends the use of the ablative of the gerund to

enote a circumstance over which the speaker has no control, rather than
instrument. This is in effect a reversion to the neutral sense of the
verbal noun, which appears in Lucretius 1. 312 anulus in digito subter
tenuatur habendo. The more personal sense is seen in comparando,
c. 5. 6, above. ’

5 instructus] ‘duly equipped': the phrase cum...manu (which ought
perhaps to be taken with venturus sit) amplifies the sense, to lay stress
on the point—the armed preliminaries of tyranny.

8 5 ¹7. suspectam...rem] ‘the case was rendered suspicions by....'

11 quidem...tamen] See note on 50. 3 above. -

12 11:181] The ablative phrase which follows itself implies a condition
(si gladii deprehensi erunt), with which, expressed in finite form, nisi

 

would be pleonastic (nisi si for nisi). But with the condition only

implied nisi is a help to clearness. The use is common enough in Livy,
. . . 1.

ef {Ins-{imum} may express both what they meant to think, and what

they were likely to think. The future participle in Livy becomes (like
