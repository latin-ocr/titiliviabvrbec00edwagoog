of conscious duplication on the part10f annalistS. Tullus (accord-
ing to Florus) omnem militarem disciplinam artemque bellandi
condidit: Cicero attributes to him the institution of the fetial
law, but Livy divides that honour, ascribing the formalities of
foedera to Tullus HostiliuS, and of the declaration of war
(res repetere) to Ancus Marcius. Tullus destroyed Alba, and
gave the Albans a home on the Caelian mount, 3ηεί their
chiefs a share in the state, the Senate, and the army. Ancus
settled Latins from Politorium, Tellenae‚ and Ficana on the
Aventine, and others near the shrine of Murcia, to connect
the Palatine and the Aventine. Tullus built a new curia, called
after him Hostilia (and it is quite probable that the building did
belong to the regal period), to accommodate the enlarged Senate:
Ancus built the prison hard by, called in later times carcer
Mamertinus ¹. 1t was he, moreover‚ who occupied and fortified
the Ianiculum, constructing the pons sublicius to connect it with
the city: and it was he who dug the Quiritium fossa to improve
the defences of Rome at the weaker points, His defensive
scheme was completed by the seizure of the silva Mesia from
the Veientines, and by the occupation of Ostia.

In this record three points of importance stand out—the
destruction os Alba, the fortification of the Janiculum‚ and the
foundation of Ostia. There is no reason to doubt the destruction
of Alba: but it is scarcely probable that there was a complete or
wholesale transference of the Albans to Rome itself. The
records of the close association of Bovillae, a town as ancient as
it is historically insignificant, with the Feriae Latinae contain
evidence which at any rate suggests that some of the evicted
Albans may have found a home there. The hegemony os the
Latin League, and the responsibilities of its maintenance, passed
to Rome: and the occupatiori and fortification of the Janiculum
indicate that Rome realised her responsibilities ln this connec-

tion it has been well said that ‘ No one who has ever stood on the
Janiculum‚ and looked down on the river 3ηεί the city, and across

Tullus Hostilius and Servius Tullius.
