Quirites dates back to this fusion. Cf. Festus, p. 254, Quirites
autem dicti post foedm· a Romulo et Tatio percussum communionem
et societatem populi faciam indicarem and the formal title populus
Romanus Quiritium (which occurs in 24. 5 and 32. 11 below). But
whence came this title os Quirites we know not for certain ι besides the
local derivation which Livy offers, there are those from quiris (curis), a
Sabine word for ⁴ spear,' and from curia ‘ ward,’ the organisation
mentioned below. The connection with curis is hard to reconcile
with the civil, non-military character which very early became attached
to the word Quirites, and was made use of by Caesar in addressing his χ
mutinous legionaries: on the other hand, curia would supply just that
basis of definite politica} organisation required, and would iudicate
that this fusion of Latins and Sabines was the real foundation of
the state.
²4 sta-tuit] ‘ halted‚’ ‘ brought up.’

curuum...appeuarunt] A different story is told in v11. 6 to

account for the name of the lacus Curtius: according to the version

there given Μ. Curtius mounted his horse, and leaped into a cavity
which had suddenly opened.

25 ἓ ⁰· ex bello-- pax] QQQQ
emphasis on the word ραι. For laeta repente pax (⁸ the gratification of

unexpected peace ⁹) cf. note on Praef. 2 novi semper scriptores. Peace
was valuable to Rome because it gave time for the further solidification
of the civic system. ,

27 curiael‘ wardsss The word (probably connected with curare,- from
a root sku, shelter) has two meaningsz(1) a building for religious
purposes (like ‘church' ); (2) a district (like‘ parish' j, whose inhabitants
dwell near the building, and meet thei-ein for periodical services and
feasts (e.g. the Fornacalia), under the supervision of a cun‘o. In both
senses the word became less religious and more political in course of
time. Legend attributes the political organisation of curiae to a person
(Romulus), as usual, but more probably it was a gradual development:
perhaps the formation of the thirty here mentioned represents a time
somewhat later than the union of Roman and Sabine communities—
the era of ‘ Tullus Hostilius ’ in fact, commemorated in the common
court-house called after him curia Hostilia, and in the comitium.

28 nomm ouum] This account (rejected by Plutarch and Varro)
is probably based on the accidental appropriateness of some of 'the
existing names (e.g. Titia, Rapta): it does not suit such titles as
Veliensts, Foriensate, which seem to have had a local origin.
