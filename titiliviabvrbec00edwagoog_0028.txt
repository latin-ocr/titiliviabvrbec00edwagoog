sense of good style—so good, indeed, that its ample pei-iotis, its
lactea abmas, almost tire the patience, and set us wishing in
perversity for some of the brevitas, the ae'mmortaltlr velocitas, of
Sallust, some os the pungency of Tacitus: just as, in Greek, we
‘might turn from the romance of Herodotus or the straightforward- Ι
ness of Xenophon to the sheer severity of Thucydides. Ι
What were the chief characteristics os Livy's style may best i
be gathered from the criticism of Quintilian given at the head
of this seeti0n1. 1t is obviously more elastic (eg. in the order of
words²)‚ more poetic, than the Ciceronian idiom: and it did
not altogether satissy the Augustan critics. We do not know
exactly what Asinius Pollio meant by the Patavim‘tas· quaedam
to which he objected in Livy: it may be that the exuberance
o‘f rhetoric was too liberal in its admission of expressions that a
sti-ieter sense regarded as non-Roman. The charm of Livy, in
spite os some adverse criticism (Caligula thought him verbosus
et neglegens3), has remained through the ages: and the en·
thusiasm of the pilgrim who travelled from Gades to Rome only
to see Livy⁴ typifies the admiration not only of the Augustan
age, but of the civilized world, for a truly Roman genius, ‘for
‘the greatest prose style that has ever been written in any age
or country⁶.'
Itis by style, then, that Livy dominates.1t may be admitted
that other writers-Thucydides Xenophon, Sallust, Caesar,
Tacitus—more strictly fulfil the function of the historian: but
it is scarcely just to compare them in this connection with Livy,
for they wrote of times not'far removed from their own, and it is
unfortunately impossible to determine the value of Livy as a
historian of the years immediately preceding and containing his
own life-time. His genius must be otherwise appraised, in his
