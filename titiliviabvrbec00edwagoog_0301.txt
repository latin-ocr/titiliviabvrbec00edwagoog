adyto dietis Cumaea Sibylla horrendas canit ambages.

3ι quadrag-tnta...talenta] See note on c. 53. 3 above. Livy uses
talenta when his authority is Fabius Pictor, who wrote in Greek: milia
pondo when his authority is Piso, who wrote in Latin.

32 Pisoni] This is L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who was consul in ι33 B.c.‚
censorin 120. He wrote seven books of annals (sane exiliter scriptos,
according to Cicer0‚ Brut. 27. 106), from the beginning os Rome to his
own day.

ὅ ⁰. quadrag-tnta...argent1] pondo is an old ablative‚ ‘by weight':
as librarum (which must be supplied here) was often omitted, pondo
became the· ordinary accompaniment of an expression denoting weight
in pounds. The sum represented here seems to be about A105‚000 of
our money, i.e. about 12 times as much as the quadraginta talenta.
Dionysius (ιν. 5ο) follows Piso here.

p. 71. 1 qmppe] The corroborative force of the particle (= ‘ nn·
doubtedly,’ ‘ obviously ’) gives additional certainty to the notions con-
tained in sperandam...exsuperaturam; cf. 111. 63. 2 quippe fuso validiore
cornu3 PhaedruS, 111. 2. 4 quidam contra miseriti, periturae quippe.
quippe is the emendation of Ι. Becker for the quia of the Mss.

3 nullius...exmperaturam] The general sense is ‘ which would
surpass in magnificence the foundations even of any of our present
buildings) Most MSS. read magnificentiae, which makes so cumbrous
a construction with nullius...0perum that Reiz reads nullorum ne huius
