Consus is probably connected with condere, i-e. ‘ the god of the
(harvest) store ’—whether kept above or below ground. So this is a
harvest-home festival—a holiday for all country-folk‚ in which horses
and mules shared. At one of the two Consualia horse-taces took place
in the Circus Maximus, which may owe its origin to the festival. So
Consus (whose altar was at one end of the Circus> came to be identified
with Poseidon Hippius (Dion. H. 11. 31), Latinized into Nsptunus
Equester. It would be natural to invite neighbours to such a merry-
making‚ and possibly the capture os wives in the course of it was not
infrequent. Fowler‚ R. F. pp. 206—9.
