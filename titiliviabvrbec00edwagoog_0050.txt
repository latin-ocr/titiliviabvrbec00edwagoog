by successful wars and secured by separate· treaties with the

several citieS, Gabii for example.
The ager Tarquiniorum—the campus Martius of historical

times ¹—seems to suggest a royal appropriation os territory; and
the existence of a vibus Tuscus shows that some Etruscans
(employed, perhapS, on the public works) lived once in Rome.
But on the Roman character, as on the Latin language, the
Etruscans made no impression. ln matters of augury, in the
formal accompaniments of authority and the embellishments of
a triumph, they introduced a certain style—we might almost
call it a professional style—of which the Romans recognized the
value and retained the practice: but the government of the
Tarquin kingS, though, like that os the Greek tyrantS, it was not
altogether or necessarily bad, imposed restraints against which·
the1 Roman patres struggled until the opposition to monarchy
expressed itsels in the expulsion of the aliens and the establish-
mentof a republiC.

ξ 7. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE cuv-sura:
SERvms TULLms,

Ancilla natus trabeam et diadema Quirini
et fasces meruit, regum ultimus ille bonorum.

JUVENAL, vm. 259—60.

In the last section it has been suggested that the record of
Servius Tullius corresponds in some respects with that of the
Tarquin kings: but the resemblance in form must not be

 

pressed‚ when the essential difference of character is so unmis- ’ ⁴

takable. To the popular mind Servius Tullius was a favourite
of fortune, a good king alive to the true interests of his people²
——so much so, indeed, that tradition made him the founder, in
idea, is not in actual fact, of many cherished institutions of the
Republic, the Father of the Plebs, Tullium qui libertatem civibus

stabiliverat3.
