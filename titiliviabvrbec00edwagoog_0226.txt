146 LIVY. I ,, [xxvr §2

unte porr-n capenam] i.e. due S. of the Palatina W. of the
Caelian Hill. The spot where Horatia was slain and ,buried (see 5 14
below) was thus near the main road from Latium, which in historicas
times (via Latina) entered the city by the porta Capena.
3² palumento] ⁸ the martial cloak ’t the word is technically used
for a gena-ars cloak.
P. 34. 1 solvit mnes] This, as monumental evidence shows, was a
customary act for female mourners.
3 5 8. nmmum] (like θυμός) ‘ anger'3 or ‘ stirred his soul‚’ as we say.
5 5 4. immaturo] ‘ unsoesonabless and therefore to a conqueror
⁸ unroesonable!

9 5 6. obstabat] ⁸ was likely to countemct,² ‘tell against ’z cf. Sallust,
Cat. 52 cetera vita eorum huic sceleri obstat.
. ηρπβ...ιά rogem] ‘ haled for trial before the king-⁹
11 nd vulg-us] ‘ in the popular view ’z cf. 9. 16 ad muliebre ingmium
efficaces.
secundum iudicium] ‘ resulting from the trial ’ ε the preposition
implies succession both in time and in effect.

12 oonassio] In the mse of Manlius (see next note) the process was
conducted by the tribunes before a concilium plebis.

duoviros] These officials are mentioned in three ceses only-here, in
that of Manlius (Livy, vl. 20) and in that of Rabirius (Cic. pm C. Rabirio
perduellzbmls· reo). In the case of Horatius, they seem to have been
special deputieS‚ appointed by the king, perhaps in order to make an
appeal to the people possible (cf. clemente legis interpretein 5 8) in a diffi-
cult case: there was no such appeal from the king’s own sentence. Or
perhaps we may suppose that, in early cases of acts regarded as specially
hurtful to the state, existing methods of justice were superseded by a
privilegium or special statute, prescribing a special procedure. Cf.
Maine, Ancient Law (14th ed.), pp. 372—35 and for the whole case
E. C. Clark, Early Roman Low, 55 11-16, and W. Ε. Heitland, Intro·
duction to Cicero’s Pro C. Rabirio.

13 perduellionem] This word is made up of per in a sinister sense (cf.
peaefidus, periurus) and duellum, i.e. bellum: it means therefore an act of
war against one’s own country, ‘treason ' (Dionysius translates it by
προδοσία), sor which minuta maiestas and cn'men maiestatis were aster-
wards used. The act of Horatius in this case was in itself a pam'ddium
(see n. on ¹3· 2) z but by killing his sister he assumed the.right of
punishment, and so committed a crime against the state, and was guilty
of perduellio. If the case were tried as perduellio, an appeal could be
