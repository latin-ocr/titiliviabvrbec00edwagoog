πο ot] ⁸ also! 'ufflmda...loca] ‘building—sites ' : aedificanda-:⁴ to
be built upou.'

2 r porum] ’‘ colonnadeS.’ . tabernae] Probably the tabernae veteres,
on the S. side of the Forum: see plan of Rome.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

α 1 ἕ 1.. muro quoque lapideo] This was eventually built by· Servius
Tullius} cf. 44. 3. For quoque see note on 33. 7.

26 vemt] subjunctive, because of anticipation implied.

27 ἓξ. dubia...caede] For the accumulation of circumstances see
note on 12. ιο. ’

29 ad comparandum...beuum] ‘ sor fresh war-preparations.’

31 centurias] ‘squam-ons) ⁸ corps’ z see note on 13. 8.

ammonumonsmpserat (the verb used in 13. 8) ⁴ had enrolled.'

32 addere aua· emutuit] It is probable that Livy here restates in
another aspect (using the lack of cavalry as a pretext) the increase which
Tarquin introduced in the privileged claris: in'other wordS, the doubling
of the Patres by the new creation mentioned in 35. 6 above is intimately
connected with a doubling of the old centuriae of cavalry. So the new
nobility were kuown as Ramnes Tities Luceres secundi (as opposed to
primi), and their cavalry as equites Ramnenses ’Titienses Lucerenses
posteriores (see 5 7 below). The total of sex centuriae (twice 3) thus
formed was included in the Servian system (see 43. 9).

It is difficult to see in this case (as in that of the Patres) what has
become of the Alban reinforcement mentioned in 3ο. 3 2 perhaps in that
chapter Livy was following a different authority from that adopted in
13. 8 and here, and did not trouble to reconcile his statements. The

gradual increase of the Equites is as obscure as that of the Patres.

P· 49· 1 58. id quia...rooerat] ⁸ because that action of Romulus
had ' waited upon augury.' inaugurato is the emphatic word of the
sentence. lt occurs again in 44. 4: sor the ablative see n. on 18. 6
augurato.

necare QQQQ...muemneque] The first negative is
here emphasized by the two alternativeS.

α Attus navim] The first name is perhaps connected with atta ⁴ father,'
the second probably with navus ‘ knowing ' z the two together make up
the augur-character, which is supposed here to represent the relig'ious
opposition of the older Patres to the innovation of Tarquin. The name
Attus appears again (Livy 11. 16) in the Sabine Attus Clausus, Romanized
as Appius Claudius.
