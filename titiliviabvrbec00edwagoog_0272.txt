resemblance to a door) was made of wood, covered with leather: iu
shape it was oblong‚ rectangular, and bent so as to envelop the body of
the warrior. It is possible that in the scutum, which in some respects
resembled the ancile (see note on c. ao. 4 above), we have a survival of
an old Pelasgian or Aboriginal pattem, as opposed to the round clipeus
of the Umbro· LatinS.

’ praeter leucum] The use of the scutum made a braestplate
unnecessary

3 §⁸- τοι-ωηο Μηπωιιῆ] If the reading ιε right, the sense is
‘ he wished those to be of the third class who ranged [from a rating os
less than 7 5‚ooo asses] to a rating of 5o‚ooo ἰ as Dionysius has it, ὅσοι
τίμησιν εἶχον ἐλάττονα, μὲν τῶν ἑπτακισχιλίων καὶ· πεντακοσίων δραχμῶν, οὔ
μείονα. δὲ μνῶν πεντήκοντα, itis inclusive, ⁴ to and including 5o,0oo ’ ε the
whole prepositional phrase is regarded (as a Greek prepositional phrase
with the article might be) as the object of the verb.

It is not necessary to bracket in, as some commentators have done.
The sense becomes simplet (‘ he wished the rating of the third class to
be a 50, οοο rating ',) but the stage in the tuing—'the terminus ad quem
of the third class—is not so wel] marked.

4 et haec] i. e. ‘this class also was (consisted of) the same number
of centuries.’ a hae is read by some editors, for the sake of sim-
plicity.

memmiae uanum] ‘ distinction of ages? between seniores and
tumores.

7 ς 0. mutata] meanS, not an actual change on the part of this class
from one armament to another, but a change in Livy‘s description-not
‘were changed ‘ but ‘ represented a change-³

num praeter hastam et verutum] i. e. they were rorarii, skir-
mishers. The verutum was a dart, three or four feet long, used by
light infantry: with the hasta this fourth class could join, if need were,
in the heavier fighting, and DionysiuS, who gives its armament as
θυρεοὺς καὶ ξίφη καὶ δόρατα, and its place as the last rank, evidently
supposes that this was the case.

8 ἕ ’1. aucta] not‘ were increasedss but ‘represented an increase' (on
the last three classes): cf. mutata above.

10 in his accensi. ‚in tres centur-tas distributi] This is the reading
of the MSS„ and as it stands it means that the accensi, cornicines and
>tubicines formed three centuries, attached to, and counted in with, the
fifth clasS. This gives a total of 193 centurie& which is the same as
that given by Dionysius. But if we regard the una centuria mentioned
