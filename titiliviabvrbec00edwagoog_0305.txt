kept them so long at the work of carpenters and the labour of slaves.’
praeter is found several times in Caesar with the inclusive sense which
it has here, ‘besideS,' ‘in addition to.’ aliam=‘in other matters,' i.e.
‘in general,‘ and so is almost equivalent to ceteram: like praeter it is
used here in an inclusive sense, that is to say, it j0ins superbia in general
(as the reason for the public animosity) with the special form of superbia
implied in the words in fabrorum...ab rege. This expression of a general
notion followed by a special case is best illustrated by the Greek idioms
ἄλλα, τε καὶ..., τά τε ἄλλα καὶ..., ἄλλως τε καὶ.... alius in this sense is
not uncommon in Livy, but it usually follows the special case or instance
which it is intended to emphasize: e. g. xxnh. 5. 7 nec ut pro signis
antesignani, post u'gna alia pugnaret acies.

regnum and rex in the present passage are intended to suggest that,
in the minds of most Romans, Tarquin had turned a kingdom into a
despotism.

p. 73. 4 sa. ommone- nummumque] ‘noemae-worm)

coepu] See n. on 39. 4.

5 ξ 4. mum] ‘ permanent camp‚’ ‘cantonments.’

6 commeatus] ‘periods of furlough,' ‘grants of leave)

7 ξ ὅ. quidemJ=706v, ‘at any rate?

8 comissationibus] ‘ carousals.’ The word comissor (=the Greek
κωμάζω) is used primarily of a festive processioa, then (as the holiday-
makers usually retired to the house os one of their number for enter-
tainment) of a revel, drinking-party: thus comissationibus here serves
appropriately as an introduction of potantibus.

10 ἕο. moni] See 38. 1.

1 1 miris modis] probably a colloquial or provincial phrase· for ‘ex-
ceedingly’ (cf. ‘wonderfully' in English): it is common in Plautus. See
note on mire 45. 7 above. Or it may be a translation from a Greek
authority who wrote θαυμασίως os: cf. 16. 8 mirum quantum.

πα 5 ’1. accenso] The metaphorical use of this word is not un-
common in Livy (who rarely employs conflare, a word of similar sense
affected by Cicero) and Tacitus: cf. xxxv. ιο. 5 certamen accendebant
fratres candidatorum, 11. 29. 8 accendi magis· discordiam quam sedari.
exardere (which denotes the result of accendere, conflare) is a common
metaphor.

mucia...horis] Collatia was about α 5 miles (across country) from
Ardea.
m] i.e. quantum...sua. sciri] ‘known ’ as opposed to ‘ disputed.’

14 quin] See note on 47. 3.
