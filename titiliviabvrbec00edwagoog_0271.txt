xmn 54] NOTES 183

a confusion between different reckonings of the as, that the terms classis,
classici belonged properly to the first classis alone, and that infra
classem included all the rest.

26 arma] ‘ armour,’ for defence (tegumenta), as opposed to tela in
hostem, for offence.

imperata] ‘required,' ⁶ requisitioned ’ (so in XL. 34. 9 arma imperata
a populo Romano). It was part os the munus os each citizen to provide
himself with the arms and equipment of the classis to which he
belonged.

cupam] (the neuter form is found more osten in Livy than the
masculine) a round shield, like the Greek ἀσπίς. Its use by the first
classis and by the equites alone suggests that it belongs to the distinctive
armour of a dominant part of the state. Cf. Ridgeway, Early Agr of
Graece, 1. p. 469.

27 omnin. ox aere] i-e. the regular bronze armour of a hoplite, which
would naturally be suggested to the Roman king by intercourse with
Greek colonies, or rather - with the Etruscans who had copied their
armament. Cf. Ridgeway, ib. p. 470.

28 hasta] This pike could probably (like that of a Greek hoplite) be
used either for throwing or sor thrusting. It was longer and more
slender than the pilum of the legionary in later times.

29 58. tabrum] The shorter form of the gen. pl. occurs chiefly, as
would be expected, in words of common use, e.g. liberum, socium.

Os the two centuries of fabri (⁶artificers, ’ ‘ engineers') here mentioned
together (as also by Dionysius) one consisted of lignarii, the other of
’ aerarii or ferrarii. In addition to the task which Livy assigns them
they would have to repair armour (hence their -association with the first
and second classes) and to make bridgeS. They had no definite place in
the· order of battle, and thus there is some difference of opinion as to
which classis they voted with in the comitia.
sapaudia acuent] ‘ were to do their service 'z the subjunctive
expresses the intention of the organization.

30 machinas] ‘ engineS‚' e.g. battering-rams, and other siege-appliances:
but there is danger of anachronism here, for few, if any, of such engines
became familiar in Greek and Roman warsare until a later date.

31 5 4. intra eentum unque ad...oensum] So Dionysius (iv. 16) says
οἷς ἦν ἐντὸς μὲν μυρίων δραχμῶν, -οὒ μεῖον δὲ πέντε καὶ ἐβδομήκοντα. μνῶν
τὸ τίμημα. Both writers wish to show that the rating os the second class

did not include 100,ooo asses.
