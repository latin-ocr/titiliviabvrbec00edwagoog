208 LI V Y. I [Lm ξ 3

The ancient authorities differ as to the date of the first coinage of
suver in Rome. Varro (de R. R. 11. 1. 9.) attributes it to Servius Tullius ε
Livy (Epit. 15) and Pliny (N. H. xxxin. 44) to the year πός-8 mc.

26 5 4.· excepit] ‘engaged,' ὀοειῳίεὼέκατέλοβα The word is not
often so used with an inanimate subject: Caemr, however, supplies
several examples.

27 propinqum] It was just 15 miles E. of Rome.

29 minime...20mm] The good saith of a Roman, like the word of
an Englishrnan, was proverbial. For the reverse of the picture we have
such expressions as xxv. 39. 1 Punica ars, Virg. Aen. u. 152 dolis
instructus et arte Pelasga.

30 &ande ac dolo]=d0lo malo. Cf. Caesar, B. C. 11. 14. 1 hostes sine

p. 68. 2 ox eampo-ito] ‘according to the plan‘: the phrase occurs in

Herodotus (111. 153—1 58), where Zopyrus similarly contrives the capture
of Babylon from the Persians.

3 ἓ O. iam ab allonis] The sentences from this point down to in-
venturum (ἓ 9) are in or. obl„ introduced by conquerens. For the

9 nam ne mutent...] This sentence explains hostes: ‘enemies... For,

make no mistake, you have a war to come, although in pretence it
is abandoned?

1 1 5 &mmmmm-1 In Italy. as in Goeece, the obligation of
hospitality was recognised and safe- ·guarded from the earliest times.
a host was bound to protect his guest, as a patron his client. The ius
hospitii was under the special protection of Iuppiter Hospitalis, in whom
we see the Latin counterpart of Ζεὺς Ξένιος. cf. Apollonius Rhodius,

Argvn111.192-3 πάντες ἐπεὶ πάντῃ, καὶ ὅτις μάλα κύντατος ἀνδρῶν, ξεινίου
αἰδεῖται Ζηνὸς θέμιν ἠδ’ ἀλεγίζει.

13 Eoi-moos] This is the first mention in Livy os that tribe which,
because of its strategical position between the Volsci and the Aequi,
became important in the triple minuce with the Romans and the Latias.
