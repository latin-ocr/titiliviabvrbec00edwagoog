praef 53] NOTES 79

ausim] ‘ would I dare) In origin this form seems to be an aorist
optative (cs. 18. 9 adclarasstlrh it occurs again in Livy, in negative
sentences. The ordinary perf. subj. is not common in apo-glosis 'a but we
may compare vll. 10. α iniussu tu'0, imperator, extra ordinem numquam
pugnaverim, non si certam victoriam videam, and the use in assertions
qualified by an implied condition, e.g. lx. 24. 7 hoc quidem ascensu
vel tres armati quamlibet multitudinem arcuerint. .. ·

32. voterem.. ,νωςαῒωιῇ ‘old.. ,over-done’. · ‘stale... stereot‘ypedss·

rom] ‘the subject)

dum.. crodunt] The phrase explains veterem.. ,vulgatam in reverse
order. dum has a quasi· -causal sense here,‘ as? ‘inasmuch as’

novi semper scriptores] ‘fresh authors in continual succession.’
Notice the position of the adverb, which Livy frequently adoptS, more
especially in descriptions of time and place. Sometimes (as here) the

adverb has almost the force of an adjective, as epithet or· predicate -

(cf. the use of adverbs with the article in Greek, e. g. ἡ ἄνω πόλις)·

sometimes it serves to emphasize the preceding word. This looser use
os adverbs is a characteristic of Silver Latin.

ln robue]‘ subjects,' ‘'matter as opposed to arte‘ style, ' ⁴ manner-‚⁹
mquid adlaturos] a phrase sor an original cOntribution to a subject.

cf. Cic. de Off Ι. 44.155 quidquid ad rem publicam attulimus, si modo ⁴

aliquid attuli-mus

ς 8. momoriae] dat. aster consuluisse (⁶ to have laboured for the ³ ·

historica! record )': the word serves to break an awkward succession of
genitives. ’

principis...popu11] ‘the Imperial Nation.’

et ipsum] (= καὶ αὐτόν) ‘ personally,' ‘ likewise,’ more emphatic
than tpsum alone would have been. Cicero uses et ipse rarely, Livy
very often, e.g. 7. 4, 12. 3, 46. 2 in Book Ι. The phrase, usually found
towards the end of a sentence, serves to couple a particular case or a
persona] climax with the remarks that have suggested or introduced it,
Cf. Propertius, 11. 16. 54 deceptus quoniam flevit et ipse deus. .

112...turna] ‘amid so vast a-crowd of authors.' This is a common .

use of in, drawing attention ⁴to the circumstances, whether favourable
or unfavourable: it may osten be best rendered by an affirmative or
adversative phrase. Cs. 17. 1 in novo popul03 17. 3 in variis voluntatibus.
rama] Cf. Martial’s Preface to his first book of Epigrams--mihi
sama vilius constet et probetur in me novissimum ingtnium.
in obscuro] == obscura, but avoids assonance: Livy affects this use
⁴of inwith a neuter adjective in predioetes.
