Tarquin the Proud intended to crush the patres, and to make a
dynasty by changing the rule of succession from the female to
the male line? As the husband of Servius’ daughter he was
qualified to succeed according to Latin usage: but to be truly
rex he needed formal sanctions of populus and patres, and he
chose to ignore the elective character of the kingship, and to
claim the throne by might, as the son or grandson of a former
king1. It is interesting to notice in this connection that the
first two consuls recorded by tradition were both of royal blood3
and that one of them, L. Junius Brutus, the son of Tarquin’s
sister, was really the heir to the throne according to the rule of
female successionss. But the connection of the change of
government with the Tarquins seems to be somewhat irregular
and arbitrary: and the traditions differ. On the one hand
there is the Roman version-that the exiled Tarquins retired
to Caere, and sought Etruscan help, and that Lars Porsenna
of Clusium, having conquered the Romans, ignored the Tarquins,
and took the kingdom for himself ε on the other hand, there is
an Etruscan tradition which tells that a Tarquin, king of Rome,
was slain and succeeded by the Etruscan Mastarna3. And
Mastama, as we have seen above, is identified according to one
tradition with Servius Tullius

Was the end of the kingship sudden at all? The analogy
os other histories would seem to suggest that it may have been
a gradual proceSS, an evolution rather than a revolution4. Yet
the reigns of the traditional Roman kings were for the most
part ended abruptly. Only two os them, Numa Pompilius and
Ancus MarciuS, died natural deaths; and these two were os
Sabine origin, and scrupulously observed the patrician ritual.
Titus Tatius met his end in a local dispute: Romulus was
‘ translated ’——or torn to pieces by the patres: Tullus Hostilius
was struck by lightning for a ritual offence ε the elder Tarquin
was slain by the ruffians of the sons of AncuS, Servius Tullius
