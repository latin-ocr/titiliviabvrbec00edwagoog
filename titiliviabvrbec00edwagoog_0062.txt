Yet for all the opposition to kingship in any form which
appears in the Roman republic of historical times, no Roman
doubted, nor can we, that, as Tacitus says ¹, urbem Romam a
pdnczpzb reges habuere. One cannot mistake the survival of
actual names—rex (sacrorum), interrex, regia, regrjugium3
the essential unity oft'mperium3 the temporary revivals of kingly
prerogative in the dictatorship3 the insignia of the supreme
magistrates, especially on ceremonial occasions such as triumphs·
Nor when the earliest constitution of the Roman republic is
examined does it reveal any really new elementS. The title of
the supreme magistrate is changed, but the imperium remains:
the republican Senate stands in the same advisory relationship·
as the regal Senate to the holders of imperium: the burgess-body
has its primary privilege of expressing its voice. To keep
whatever was possible, to preserve form even where little or no
reality remained; to be conservative, in short, was the true
Roman character. The interaction of the forces in the state
might ancl did bring about momentous changes in the relations
of magistrate5‚ senate, and citizen-body. A senate which con-
sisted of members serving for life could ,not but exercise far
more control over two annually-elected officers than over a king
who was elected for life: and similarly, a burgess-body which
was called on to electits supreme magistrates once a year would
thus be frequently and forcibly reminded of its sovereign power,
, and would realise that its votes were not only competent, but
necessary, for the passing of laws and the proper judgment of
capital cases. And lastly‚ the growth of the non-patrician
element, in such a state as Rome was in the century 550—
450 13.c., brought it about, if not at once upon the end of the
kingship, at any rate before long, that the machinery of the
popular vote should be exercised in more democratic assemblies
such as the comitia centuriata and the concilia plebis, and not
in the more or less patrician comitia curiata. The growing
experience of a young republic would account for all this
development: but the possibility of such development, the germs
of political consciousness, were latent in the state while kings
