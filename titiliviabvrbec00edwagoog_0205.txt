(Now Livy speaks here os centum patres, and in· 8. 7 (see note) he
told us· that Romulus chose that number to be his senatores; of whom
it was said patres certe ab⁴ honore, patriciique progenies eorum appellatt'.
He thus bases on privilege what··Professor Ridgeway bases on ethnology.
N or' is Livy sar wrong in speaking of ordines in this connection, for these
senatorial patres and patricii may‘well have constituted a distinct ordo,
a privileged nobility‚ apart from other patres familias of the gentes
forming the state ι so in 18. ⁴5 patres and cives are mentioned separately,
and probably factionibus inter ordines certabatur (g 1 above) means that
there was a contest between the'- privileged and· non-privileged families
for the ‘choice- of a king.. The patres proper regard with a jealous eye
any action on the part of the king which was ‘ popular,’ i.e. tended to
break down· the barrier ,of 'their exclusiveness, or to increase the
importance of any members of the state outside their class3 and, when
the Tarquins were expelled, the ‘patre's resumed the· imperium as of -
right, in ⁴the person 'of magistrates selected from the patricii.

(i. e. until the end of the Regal period), -it retained the final sanctions of

conceded the lesser powerS, but retained the greater, they abandoned
the Senate as their own sphere of political influence, and appropriated
the powers of final sanction to their own body. This was the last
barrier of exclusiveness which the Plebeian reformers had to pass z they
passed it not by abolishing the patrum auctoritas, but by making it a
preliminary and not a final sanction. This was achieved by the Lex
Publilia os 339.B.c.‚ and by the Lex Maenia of a later date ε· to this
