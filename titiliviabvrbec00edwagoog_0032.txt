Lupercalia, and the presence of the wolf among the old standards
of the Roman army, seem to suggest something of the kind.
The bronze statue of the she—wolf with the twins as her foster-

emblematic association of the she-wolf with the origins of Rome:
but there is evidence elsewhere in Italy of the existence of the
emblem at an earlier period. A few years ago I was interested
to find and sketch in the Museo Civico at Bologna a large stone
stele‚ one of many brought from the Certosa near by, which

the civilisation to which these stelae belong. We know that the
city of Felsina (Bologna) was captured from the Etruscans by
the Boian Gauls about 400 B.c., and before the Etruscans there
may have been (according to some authorities) a Pelasgian
occupation‚ and before that an Umbrian³. There are points of

undoubted resemblance between the she-wolf stele and certain .

slabs discovered at Mycenae ; and, while it is impossible to
determine as yet the origin of the emblem, it is just conceivable
that there lurks in it a secret of the migrationS, Pelasgian,
Umbrian, Sabine, which were bound up with the first-beginnings
of Rome. Sanguine} altricem non pudet esse lupam.

as Umbrian, the composition of the groups and panels as Greek, the
