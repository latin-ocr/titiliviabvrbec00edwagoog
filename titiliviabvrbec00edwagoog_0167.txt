Ardea.
pacta ruerat] Does this mean that the act of betrothal had taken
place, or that the state of betrothal was over? Probably the latter: ’
Riemann, in his Etudcs sur la langue et la grammaire deTite-Live (pp. 2 r 3
and foll.)‚ has indicated clearly that the use of suerat with a pf. part. in
Livy denotes in most cases 'a state which had existed previously to the

AborigineS, before the Etruscan occupation: other authorities agree
with this statement, which is supported by the discovery of an alphabet
differing in arrangement from the Etruscan. Strabo (p. ατο) gives a
story connecting the change of name with the Etruscan capture. cf.
