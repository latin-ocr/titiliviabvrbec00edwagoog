PREFACE

N edition undertaken as a πάρεργον in a busy life is

Ι apt to delay its appearance3 and in the present
instance the nine-year canon of Horace has been more
than satisfied. Yet in a decade when excavations' in the
Forum and elsewhere have revealed new evidence for the
period with which Livy's first book is concerned a certain
delay was not altogether dangerouS. -

To two friends this book, ‘ as in private duty bound)
expresses its first and most fervent thanks: to Mr Leonard
Whibley‚ Fellow of Pembroke College, for valued advice
and criticism3 and to Professor Ridgeway‚ not only for
what his pen has contributed to the study of prehistoric
Italy, but for the kindness of his audienee‚ and the keen-
ness of his criticism‚ at'a rect‘tatio of the introduction.

ΤΙιε text of W. Weissenborn and H. J. Miiller has been
generally followed. It seemed undesirable, in an edition of
’ this kind, to provide a regular apparatus crim-us: the more
important questions of reading are therefore considered in
the general notes ad loca, and a short list of the principal

emendations adopted is tabulated for reference on a separate .

page. A correspondence with Professor R. 'S. Conway,
begun by a fortunate meeting over the Medicean MS. at
Florence some years ago, enabled certain points in the text
to benefit'by his experienced criticism.

No one can study the first book of Livy without ap-
preciating the value of the edition published by Sir John
Seeley in 1870: the historical investigations contained in

his introduction have still the power to stimulate inquiry ,

and to steady judgment. The Weissenborn-Miiller edition
