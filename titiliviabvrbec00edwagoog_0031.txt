INTRODUCTION xxv

the Rutuli, whose centre was Ardea3 the cult of Iuppiter Indtges
near the river Numicus was a proper focus for the mystic battle
and ‘translation ' of Aeneas ¹ ; and the realities of Etruscan tyranny
were dramatically embodied in the ferocity of a Mezentius,

The coming of Aeneas to Italy was necessarily dependent in
point of time upon the capture of Troy, between-which and the
traditional date of the foundation of Rome (753 Rc.) there was a
gap of about four centuries. This gap the story-makers filled in by
expanding ,what was probably a genuine line of Latin, or rather
Alban, kings—the Silvii—-into a list of names which illustrated
the various elements of the tradition, and betrayed· in its very
composition the hand of a Greek. With the Alban kings the
familiar legend of the foundation of Rome itself is connected.
In Romulus we have surely no more than a mere adjective, ‘ther
man of Rome,' a variant in fact of Romanus. As founder Romulus
takes (towards the end of the fourth century B.c.) the place which·
other traditions had ascribed to Aeneas: and originally he had no
twin brother. Remus seems to owe his creation to a duplicating
tendency, everywhere apparent in the records of Rome—the
tendency which is seen in the two LareS, the two sets of Salii,
the two consuIS, and so one-due perhaps originally to the union of
separate communitieS. The familiar legend, which makes a god
the father, and a Vestal2 the mother of the famous Twi-ns, is
entirely in keeping with what seems to have been the regular
genealogy of Latin kings, The' union of god and Vestal reapff
pears in one story of Servius Tullius' birth, and it is supported
by many points in the relationship of Latin kings to Vestals and
in the ritual of the Vestals themselves³.

.. What, then, is, the significance of the she-wolf in the tale of
the Twins? It is perhaps simplest to regard the wolf as the
representative emblem of one of -the tribes which shared in the
