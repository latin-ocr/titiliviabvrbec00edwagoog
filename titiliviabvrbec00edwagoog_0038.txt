xxxii LIV Y I

the patron-saintl, as we may call it, than the betrayer of the
Tarpeian height.

The institutions assigned by tradition to the reign of
Romulus are the Lictors; the Senate3 the spolia opima3 the
thirty curiae3 and the three centuriae of knights. The lictors,
in regard to their association with sacra as well as with the
person os the chief magistrate, undoubtedly date from the
regal period: but it is not certain whether the institution was
derived from Etruriass. The spolia opima may well have
belonged to the earliest days : but the dedication os thern on the
Capitol seems rather to belong to the time when Roman and
Sabine elements were joined into one community. The question
of the Senate and of the patres who formed it is discussed in
detail in the notes⁸. If we interpret Livy's statement, that the
titIes patres and patricii marked the selection of certain heads of
families to form the Senate, by connecting patres with the Sa-
bineS, it follows that the creation of the Senate itself dates from the
fusion of Romans (montani) and Sabines (collini) into one body-
politiC, the Quirites, under Sabine domination. This doubling
of the city (geminata urbe is Livy’s phrase in e. 13. 5) brought
the Forum, hitherto a swamp, and the Capitol-Quirinal into the
new pomerium ; and this was accomplished by ‘Titus Tatius⁴,'
that is to say by the Sabine leader, whom we are thus tempted
to regard as the real founder of the city, and perhaps as the
giver of its name. The SabineS, as belonging to the Umbrian
race, burnt their dead; and the cremation-graves in the

Forum-cemetery may have been made at this time, after some ·

preliminary draining of the marsh, when the Forum was no

longer needed as a neutral ground between rival communitieS.
The division of the people in curiae, different in character

from the gentes⁵‚ is common to Romans and to LatinS, and in
