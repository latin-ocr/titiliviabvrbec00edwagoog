probably comes from the same source, meaning ⁴ Stream-city ' (cf.
Στρύμη, Reate). Is εο, Rb'mulus and leus (Gk Ῥῶμος) are simply
two forms for the inhabitant thereos. The form Romularem was pro·
bably due to two causes: (1) the derivation of an earlier spelling
Rumularem from rumi53 (α) the desire to connect the tree with
Romulus. The lig-trec was closely associated with the Fauni (called
sometimes ficarii).

nuno] Cf. the lines of Ovid quoted above. It was situated near the
Lupercal, on the W. side of the Palatine.

¹4 emunt] The exposui-e of the children reminds us of the stories
of Moses and of, Cyrus. ·

15 tonet fama] Cf. κατέχει λόγος, Thuc. Ι. 10.

16 §0- alveum] ‘basket,’ ‘tray': used for a boat also (cf. Virg.
Aen. Vl. 41² accipit alveo Aeneam), and for the bed of a river.

17 tuuis} has practically the force of a separate clause, ‘ because it was
shallow': cf. 7. 9 manifestae, 50. 3 in absentem.¹ For the epithet, cf.
Cicero de Repub. 11. 34 influxit enim non tenuis quidam e Graecia rivulus
in hanc urbem3 and Propertius, 1. .r 1. 11.

19 summissas] probably predicate with praebuisse, ⁴ stooped and gave)

το lingua lambentemJ Cf. Ovid, Fasti n. 418 aefingit lingua corpora
bina πασς Virg. Aen. vm. 634 corpora fingere lingua. The dam (it is
thought) aids with her tongue the development of new-born limbs: from
which comes the phrase ‘ lick into shape.'

N‚1¹¹mutulo] For the dat. see n. on r. 3 Troiano. Here (as in 50. 3)
ei is to be supplied.

The name Faustulus here is an attempt to connect the origins of
Rome with the worship of Faunus. Faustulus (like Faustus) is con-
nected with favere, and means therefore ‘ the kind one ἐ Faunus is by
some traced to the same source, by others connected with fari (i.e. ‘the
prophet '), or with Favonius (from a root pu, ‘ purify ’). There were
many Fauni, spirits of the wood-perhaps an ancient woodland race
themselves—who could help or hurt crops and cattle3 prophetie some-
times ·in warning or encouragement. This ancient numen of the
country was utilised for their own purposes by priests and annalists:

. for the former he became Pan, the god of the Lupercalia z for the latter
a mythical king of Latium, connected with the mythical Evander——
identical with him, if we may accept one modern view which regards
Evander as a translation of the Latin Faunus, made to< suit the graeciz-

ing tendency os the earliest Roman archaeologists. Fowler, Roman
Festivals‚ pp. 257—265.
