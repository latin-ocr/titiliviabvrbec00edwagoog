88 LIVY. I [11§3

civitas sine suffragio (Aul. Gellius, xvl. 13): afterwards the phrase
in tabulas Caeritum referri became equivalent to partial dissi-anchisement.

Θ nimio plus] ‘far more’ :.cf 11. 37. 4 nimio plus quam velim:
xxlx. 33. 4 multitudine, quae nimio maior erat. A colloquial use,
common in Plautus: cf. our ‘far and away)

7 haud mnam] ‘without reluctance' ε the form gravatim (rare for.
gravate) is due to a false analogy with old fem. accusatives like partim,
statim.

9 §m commit-ret] ‘win, ' ‘secure’z cf. 46. 1, · 27. 1 (reconciliare).

ιο Iatinon] 1f Latium comes from a root prat, ‘’smoothe (cf. πλατύς),
it means ‘Broadland,’ ‘’:Lowland so Latini: Lowlandem, Plain· ·3men
cf. πεδιεΐς, τεδιακοί.

14 Etruria] The evidence of archaeology supports the statement here
made. Traces of Etruscan occupatiori have been discovered in the Po
valley, on the Adriatic sea-board, in the territory of the Volsci, in
Campania, in Rome itself, in Corsica, and perhaps in Sardinia. It is
‚not certain whether they expanded from the north after a land-migration
to Italy, or came to Etruria by sea, and thence moved outwards, north
and south. The ancient authoritieS, Herodotus (1. 94), Strabo (p. 219)
and Velleius Paterculus (Ι. 1), hold the latter view, which seems the more
probable. Their history is made up of conflicts with their neighbours
—LigurianS‚ Umbriam, Greek semem, GauIS, and Romans. To them-
selves they were Rasennas (cf. Dion. Hal. 1. 30. 3 αὐτοὶ μέντοι σφᾶς
αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ἡγεμόνων τινὸςῬασέννᾳ τὸν αὐτὸν ἐκείνῳ τρόπον ὀνομάζουσι),
from which by some such form as Tu—Rasena, Tarsena, Τυρσηνοί may
have come: to the Umbrians they were Strangers (Etruscus, Etruria
are supposed to be derived from Umbrian etru=alter). They were, as
‘Livy states, a maritime power3 they developed a sea-trade, and fought*
as allies of Carthage against the Phocaeans (536 Β. c. ) and against
Cumae (474).

16¹ implesset] Livy uses many such contracted forma, e. ..g 7. 7 mugis-
sent; 1 1. 9 petisse.

and the note, on 15. 6 creditae, below. As Varro drily put it: sed
