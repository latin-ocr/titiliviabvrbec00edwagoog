142 LI VY. I [xxrv ἓ 4

scrin] ‘ strike a treaty ’—i.e. strike the victim sacrificed to solemnize
the treaty: cf. 1. 9.

ιι, mina] ‘handfuls’ of sacred herbs‚ to secure the envoys from
‚violation3 taken from the Arx on the Capitoline, and carried by one of
the filiales, called from his office verbenarius.

12 puram tofflto] sc. herbam, verbenam, ‘thou shalt take it fresh 'z or
perhaps puram implies that no knife was to be used=‘ untainted.’

¹4 56. thltium] See n. on 13. 5 above. ‘The Roman nation of
the Quirites’ seems to denote the composite community in which the
Sabines (Quin'tes) had a dominant share, though the form Quirites
may be non-Sabine. populo Romano Quiritibus also occurs,

ma comasque] ‘ my badges (symbols) and retinue.' The former
refers to the verbenae, silex, and sceptrum: the latter to the other fetiales
sent on the mission. The sceptrum was naturally carried by the pater
patratus as king's deputy.

15 u en used to in rayer: cf. 28. 1 quod bene vertat.

nine stando...R-oman1] ‘ without hurt to myself or the R. nation.’
The gen. gopuli is objective‚ and likewise the gen. implied in mea.

17 ἓ Β. Valerius...Pu31um (archaic for Furiumss. Two more Roman
gentes are thus introduced.

18 verbena] (=sagmina) ‘slip,’ ‘ sprig’ : cf. Servius on Virg. Aen. ΧΠ.
120, verbenas vocamus omnes frondes sacratas, ut est hum, oliva, vel
myrtus.

19 ad ius iamdum...foedm] ‘ Is elected to execute the oath, i.e.
ratify the treaty.’ Possibly in the two expressions we may trace a
double form, part Roman, part Sabine.

2ο effata] passive, ‘ pronounced‚' ‘ recited.’

carmine] ‘ strain,' ‘ form,’ perhaps in Saturnian metre, in which the
earliest religious and legal forms were commonly composed. Cf. 26. 6
lex horrendi carminis erat .· 32. 8.

non operae est] ⁶ it is not worth while.' operae is interpreted some-
times as a gen. (as it certainly is in the phrase operae pretium, cf. Praef.
ἓ 1 above), but is more probably a dative in predicate, lit. ‘it is a matter
for trouble, attention.’ Cf. Roby, ξ 482 (a), 516.

21 referre] ‘quote,’ ‘repeat.’ peragit] Cf. 18. 103 32. 8.

ἓ ’1. legibus] as above, ‘ conditions.’

23 audi tu] It seems unnecessary to read audito (3rd pers.) which has
been suggested as an emendation (Schenkl), on the ground that the
third clause of such a formula usually applies to the third person: cf.
32. 6 auaiat fas.
