because they could not, approve the election of a popular, or
non-patrician, king. Tarquinius Priscus seems to have had the

popular will on his side at the beginning of his reign ¹, and
Servius Tullius began his rule in general acquiescence²; and
both kings may have been duly confirmed in the imperium
by a lex curiam-⁹⁹: but Tarquinius Superbus had neither popular
nor patrician support. ln such cases the auspicia remained with
the patres, in abeyance : and the king himself, though de facto
and even de iure ruler‚ was in ritual opposition to them, an
opposition illustrated by the introduction of new cults (as of
Diana by ServiuS, and of the Capitoline Jupiter by the Tarquins)
and the creation of new patres by Tarquinius Priscus. So the
revolution—or the evolution--which brought the kingship to an
end was no popular movement‚ but a patrician reaction: the
keynote of it was auspicia ad patres redeunt.

Regio imperio duo sunta. The idea of imperium, destined
to be the greatest contribution of Rome to politics, can scarcely
have attained a full-grown force in the regal period, though the
accounts given by the Roman historians might almost lead us
to suppose so. Yet even in embryo it stands for magistracy
rather than monarchy‚ for the supreme authority consen-ed (or
confirmed) by a formal act of the burgess-body (lex curiata).
1t is in theory unlimited‚ but not irresponsible, nor un-
responsive to counsel and custom4. The king who holds it is
at once commander, judge‚ and president in chief. And
the Romans seem to have realised so clearly what this imperium
implied, without reference to the person of the holder, that they
preserved its integrity through the transition from monarchy to
republic. The two chief magistrates of the republic possessed
the regium imperium, unimpaired in idea, though balanced in
a sense by duality of persons—the colleg-iate principle—and
