representatives= ιοο. ab honore] Cf. 3 3 ab numeru 17. 6 id ab re...
interregnum appellatum.

oentum...apneuan. These sentences introduce the problem of the
patres, which recurs in c. 1⁷· Livy here ascribes the creation of a
Senate to Romulus, and attributes the titloe patres, pacni-ii to the
privilege of membership thereos: Dionysius states that Romulus formed
his Senate on a representative basim ἐκ τῶν πατρικίων ἄνδρας ἑκατὸν
ἐπιλεξάμενος. In other words„ Livy says they were patres because they
were senatores, and Dionysius vice versa. Possibly the truth may rest in
part with both views. The patres familias, i-e. chiefs of claris, united
to form the original state, must have met for the conduct of common
affiiirs before a king was chosen: he continued the council‚ but con-
trolled its composition by his own choice, i.e. he formed an order from
the patres familias and their families, patricii (=those who possessed a
chief or paterfamilias), ⁸ clansmen. ’ The members of this order, supple-
mented perhaps from time to time by a fresh choice of senators (lectio
senatus) on the part of the King, naturally appropriated the titles patres,
patricii for themselves and their descendants: in this sense Livy may be
right in saying patros certe ab honore, patr-:cuque progenies eorum appellati.
Cicero (de Rep. ιι. ²3) holds the same view. For the further develop-
ment of the question, see notes on patres in c. ¹⁷·

Θ ἓ 8. urben...misoere] The arguments of the envoys are thrown
